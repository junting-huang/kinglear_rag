Furthermore, Lear seeks information from the people surrounding the ""mongrel"" saying ""How now, my pretty knave? How dost thou?""

1	f	1	"Before dividing the kingdom, Lear requests that his daughters demonstrate their love for him by declaring the extent of their affection. To do so, he asks them to ""tell the true ingredient of mine honour, / Strange information"" (Passage 1). He seeks a display of their love, saying ""I would learn that"" (Passage 5). This is reiterated when he asks Goneril and Regan to ""give me my daughter"" (Passage 6), emphasizing the need for a demonstration of their loyalty and love."

This demand is evident in Passage 5: ""I would learn that; for, by the marks of sovereignty, Knowledge, and reason, I should be false persuaded I had daughters."" Lear also expects them to substantiate their claims of love with specific actions: he wants them to demonstrate their love by comparing their verbal declarations to their material presents, as hinted at in Passage 10: ""Come, come, I am a king; My masters, know you that?"" Additionally, Lear wants his daughters to express their love to him individually, not collectively. This is hinted at in Passage 1 and Passage 3, where Lear addresses each daughter separately and seeks private audiences with them."

1	f	3	"Before dividing the kingdom, Lear asks his daughters to express how much they love and cherish him by telling him how much they adore their father in a personal, rather than material, way. As he wants personal affection and loyalty rather than material riches, Lear asks his daughters to do this, as shown in Passage 5, ""I would learn that; for, by the marks of sovereignty, Knowledge, and reason, I should be false persuaded I had daughters"". This shows Lear's misunderstanding of what his daughters might say, as he believes true devotion to him should come from personal love rather than material inheritances; However, in Passage 3, we see Lear instruct his servants, ""Go you and tell my daughter I would speak with her."" This shows that, before asking his eldest daughter to speak, Lear seeks her presence. Furthermore, Passage 1, ""What dost thou profess? What wouldst thou with us?"", implies that Lear is asking his eldest daughter what she would do if she had the chance, indicating that he wants his eldest daughter to have the chance to express herself, and then make a statement about his youngest daughter, implying that he wants his youngest to also express some personal affection to their father."

1	f	4	"Before dividing the kingdom, Lear asks his daughters to declare their love for him and their recognition of him as their father. This is achieved through a series of tests where each daughter is called upon to speak their love for Lear. From Passage 3, Lear says, ""Go you and tell my daughter I would speak with her."", suggesting that he already has a relationship with his daughters. However, as the play progresses, Lear demands a more explicit display of their love for him, and so from Passage 5, he expresses a desire to engage with them in this way by asking ""I should be false persuaded I had daughters"", implying that he needs to see this for himself. Finally, Passage 7 shows Lear's expectation that his daughters should take care of him in his old age, as he says, ""Hast thou given all to thy two daughters, and art thou come to this?"", revealing that he is expecting them to show devotion to him as their father."

1	f	5	"Based on the passages provided, it appears that Lear requests his daughters to come forward and declare how much they love him, so that he may determine how much of his kingdom to give to each of them. This is supported by Passage 5, where Lear asks, ""I would learn that; for, by the marks of sovereignty, Knowledge, and reason, I should be false persuaded I had daughters."" and Passage 6, where Lear gives a general instruction to a servant to summon his daughters to speak with him. In Act 1, Scene 1 of the play, Lear actually asks his daughters to ""Love and bring no uncommontion"" (Passage 8 is not present in the final published version of the play; I apologize for the inclusion), indicating that he would like them to come forward with their expressions of love, and he will then divide his kingdom accordingly. However, in the final act I reference (there is no evidence that Lear divides the kingdom) and the actual scenario, Lear ultimately does not give much real estate to any child, dividing Goneril, Cordelia, and Regan between an additional character named a third daughter and an unnamed Duke."

1	f	6	"Lear does not explicitly ask his daughters to do something before dividing the kingdom with the passages provided, but rather requests to speak with them before making any decisions. As evident from Passage 3, ""Go you and tell my daughter I would speak with her,"" Lear intends to converse with Cordelia before dividing the kingdom. However, before this decision, Lear asks his daughter Goneril if she would ""show the huge and gouty King The top of oath"" in Passage 5 isn't present, but another part of the dialogue not present suggests he asks Goneril if her love for him surpasses ""Knowledge, and reason,"" but a more pertinent line that suggests the content of the question is actually Passage 4: ""How now, my pretty knave? How dost thou?"" In this instance, King Lear is seemingly asking his daughters how they perceive themselves, which he considers in relation to the act of division. From the given passages, the content of King Lear's question to his daughters that is most relevant is likely asking them of which is to be valued the most: their love and affection for him, or their loyalty and commitment to their role."

1	f	7	"Before dividing the kingdom, Lear asks his daughters to declare how much they love him, specifically that he might know their ""true"" affections. He plans to divide his kingdom among the one who exhibits the most devotion. Passages 5 and 9 suggest Lear intends to distribute the land among his children proportionally to their expressions of affection. Before dividing the kingdom, Lear instructs his daughter on how to greet him properly, showing respect and deference as befits a king's daughter: ""What, have his daughters brought him to this pass?"". This shows Lear's expectation of certain behavior from his daughters. This expectation is also reflected in ""How now, my pretty knave? How dost thou?"" (Passage 4), as well as ""How now? Where's that mongrel?""."	RAG	What does Lear ask his daughters to do before dividing the kingdom?	1
1	f	8	"Before dividing the kingdom, Lear asks his daughters to declare their love for him. As Lear prepares to divide his kingdom among his daughters, he asks, ""How now, my pretty knave? How dost thou?"" (Passage 4), revealing his desire for their affection and loyalty. Specifically, Lear wants to know ""What dost thou profess? What wouldst thou with us?"" (Passage 1), suggesting he wants to hear their confessions and promises of loyalty before making his decisions. Lear is also concerned with their marriage, asking ""If I had pluck'd thy hair for it, wouldst thou have giv'n it him? They'd have been sweeter than a spring odours of Arabia red"" (not available, however, Passage 3 implies he would speak with his daughter), but there are no relevant quotes for this question, hence my response focuses on the above."

1	f	9	"Before dividing the kingdom, Lear asks his daughters to give him news, specifically the ""marks of sovereignty"" (Passage 5). However, this request is a rhetorical one, as Lear knows his daughters are alive, and he seeks reassurance that they are indeed his rightful inheritors. This is evident in his query, ""I would learn that; for, by the marks of sovereignty, Knowledge, and reason, I should be false persuaded I had daughters"" (Passage 5). Lear's request is not about asking them to perform a task, but rather a demand for proof of their existence. He does not actually ask them to do something specific before dividing the kingdom; rather, he seeks validation of their status as his daughters. Overall, Lear's request is a test of their loyalty and identity."	RAG	What does Lear ask his daughters to do before dividing the kingdom?	0
1	f	10	"Before dividing the kingdom, Lear asks his daughters to declare their love for him, as evidenced in Passage 4 and Passage 5. This is a condition for him to be able to "" Divide my property"" among them (not explicitly stated in the passages provided, but seen in the larger play). From the passages, we see Lear interacts with his daughters before declaring his plan to divide the kingdom. He asks his daughters to ""Say what I am and how you come here"" (Passage 1) and, earlier in the play (not provided), he asks ""How much duty knows a daughter this is?"" suggesting he seeks their affection and devotion. The question suggests that, when asking ""How now, my pretty knave?"" he inquires about what the ""child"" of his love has become (""How doth thy love content thee?"" is another version of this line) (Passage 4). Passage 5 gives a more explicit statement: ""I would learn that; for, by the marks of sovereignty, Knowledge, and reason, I should be false persuaded I had daughters""; Lear wants his daughters to express their love for him as it would be expected of a daughter from a father."

1	f	11	"Before dividing the kingdom, King Lear asks his daughters to declare their love for him and state how much they esteem their father in order to determine which one of them will receive the largest share of the kingdom. This can be seen from Passage 4, with Lear saying ""How now, my pretty knave? How dost thou?"" However, it becomes apparent that this request is not the question from Lear, instead he is asking Goneril's steward, Osward's servant and to others for their views of their lords and ladies. Lear learns from them that they think their masters and lords are kind and generous. In Passage 5, Lear announces to Cordelia, ""I would learn that; for, by the marks of sovereignty, Knowledge, and reason, I should be false persuaded I had daughters"". This is the request Lear is asking Cordelia and his other daughter, Goneril. He learns that from Passage 7, with ""Hast thou given all to thy two daughters, and art thou come to this?"" This shows that Lear is not pleased with their answer as he states, ""Nothing could have subdu'd nature to such a lowness, but his unkind daughters"", as in Passage 9."""

1	f	12	"Lear asks his daughters to tell him if they love him; he then asks them to declare their love aloud before he considers dividing the kingdom among them. This is best supported by Passage 5: ""I would learn that; for, by the marks of sovereignty, Knowledge, and reason, I should be false persuaded I had daughters."" It is also supported by Passage 10, which shows Lear wants to confirm his authority with some acknowledgement of loyalty from his children, ""Come, come, I am a king; My masters, know you that?"" Unfortunately, one of Lear's daughters, Cordelia, does state something similar, ""Sir, I love you most dearly, having no other cause to chouse the name"" (Act 1, Scene 1), in response to Lear's request. This is mentioned in Passage 2 ""How now? Where's that mongrel? Knight: He says, my lord, your daughter is not well."" suggests that Goneril or Regan is ""not well,"" a common way to communicate with Lear.

1	f	13	"Before dividing the kingdom, Lear asks his daughters to declare how much they love him, saying ""Give me the reason why I should deny That my daughters should proceed me in wealth / I in the reversion of our father's time?"" (Passage 5). This request is a test of their love and loyalty, a condition for dividing the kingdom. If they can demonstrate sufficient love, they will receive a share of the land. He expects a response from them, which prompts several daughters to come forward and make declarations of their love for him. It is essential to note that Lear's decision to divide the kingdom among his daughters is a significant part of the play's events, but I can see I've picked parts of the passages not directly related to the question asked. My revised answer focuses on a specific part of the original question: Before dividing the kingdom, Lear asks his daughters to ""tend the great bounty / Less known by his form” (Passage 5) which implies a demonstration or expression of their parental relationship. He wants to ""know"" (Passage 5) their love for him."	RAG	What does Lear ask his daughters to do before dividing the kingdom?	0

Before dividing the kingdom, Lear asks his daughters to express their love and affection for him and provide him with evidence of their loyalty and devotion to hear their testimonies before he proceeds with the division of the kingdom. As Lear says, ""I would learn that; for, by the marks of sovereignty, Knowledge, and reason, I should be false persuaded I had daughters."" (Passage 5) He commands his servants to bring his daughters before him: ""Give me my daughter Goneril. Bring the strongest basilisks to thunder her to me."" (This passage is not provided, but the original prompt includes Passage 3, ""Go you and tell my daughter I would speak with her."") and Passage 4, ""How now, my pretty knave? How dost thou?"" This shows that Lear first summons his daughters to appear before him.

Passages 2 and 3, however, indicate that the daughters' love is the initial reason for Lear's division of the kingdom. In Passage 2, his loyal knight informs Lear that Lear's daughter is unwell, which prompts an inquiry as to how to communicate with this daughter, suggesting that Lear plans to discuss his division of the kingdom with her directly, as stated in Passage 3."

1	f	17	"Before dividing the kingdom, Lear asks his daughters to express their love for him in words. Although it is not explicitly stated in the passages provided, it can be inferred that this is the task he is thinking of, as seen in Passage 1, where Lear says ""What dost thou profess?"" implying a desire to hear a declaration of love or devotion. According to Passage 4, Lear expresses a desire to ""learn"" if he has daughters, suggesting that he is seeking an acknowledgment or admission of their existence. The actual passage that corresponds to the task Lear is asking his daughters to do is not directly available in the prompt, as the passages provided are fragmented. However, in one of the missing passages from the play, Act 1 Scene 1, Lear says to his daughters: ""How sharper than a serpent's tooth, to have a thankless child!"" which suggests that he is expecting a statement of love and gratitude from his daughters in exchange for his love and generosity.

Lear asks his daughters to say how much they love him in order to determine their share of the kingdom (Passage 4: ""How now, my pretty knave? How dost thou?""). This seems to imply that Lear intends to divide his kingdom among those who are able to express their love for him. In fact, Lear reveals that he is considering dividing his kingdom based on how much his daughters claim to love him (Passage 5: ""I would learn that; for, by the marks of sovereignty, Knowledge, and reason, I should be false persuaded I had daughters""), implying that their love is a key factor in his decision. Lear summons his daughters to speak with him, suggesting that he is about to engage them in a conversation about their love and the division of his kingdom (Passage 3: ""Go you and tell my daughter I would speak with her""), which will likely determine the distribution of his wealth and power."

1	f	19	"Lear asks his daughters to express their love for him before dividing the kingdom among them. This is evident when he famously declares: ""Go you and tell my daughter I would speak with her"" (Passage 3), indicating that he wants to hear their professions of love before dealing with the division of the kingdom. In Act 1, scene 1, Lear's true intent is revealed when he asks his daughters to ""express their love"" for him: ""How now, my pretty knave? How dost thou? / I would learn that; for, by the marks of sovereignty, Knowledge, and reason, I should be false persuaded I had daughters"" (Passage 4). This shows that Lear is seeking their love as a condition before he distributes the kingdom.

This request is later revealed as a ploy to provoke them into revealing their true nature: ""Give me my servant forth. Go tell the Duke and's wife I'ld speak with them-"" (Passage 6).

It is evident in Lear's dialogue that he wants to use this method to decide how to share his kingdom appropriately. In Passage 1, Lear asks ""What dost thou profess? What wouldst thou with us?"" However, this is not directly related to the question. In Passage 7, Cordelia, who had initially obeyed Lear's command, reveals what happened next: ""I am sure Cassandra my daughter never did love me so dear, nor fancy me a father so dearly as my sisters do"". Here, it is Lear's own daughter Cordelia who first proposes her love, then Lear's other daughters follow suit. In Passage 5, Lear says ""I would learn that; for, by the marks of sovereignty, Knowledge, and reason, I should be false persuaded I had daughters.""

How dost thou? / Lear: I would learn that; for, by the marks of sovereignty, / Knowledge, and reason, I should be false persuaded / I had daughters."" Since Lear has doubts about their virtues, he seeks to gauge their affection for him. The passage highlights his query: ""Lear: What dost thou profess? What wouldst thou / With us?""

Lear also tests his daughters, seeking a more honest answer from Goneril, the eldest, about her love for him, ""How now, my pretty knave? / How dost thou?""

Edmund's motivation for blinding his father is revenge and a desire for power, as he seeks to usurp his father's authority and claim his own right to inherit the title. Gloucester's line ""What needed then that terrible dispatch of it into your pocket?"" (Passage 2) implies that Edmund's actions were unnecessarily cruel and violent. Additionally, Edgar's aside in Passage 6, ""How should this be?"" suggests that he finds it hard to believe Edmund would commit such an atrocity, implying that Edmund's behavior is unusual and motivated by a sinister intent."

Edmund's actions are driven by a desire for gain and a disregard for the well-being of others. Passage 1 and Passage 5 from the prompt suggest this conclusion: Gloucester asks Edmund how his eye was ""taken in"" (concealed), implying that Edgar was the one to do so who brought ""this"" to Edmund. Gloucester is upset that being blinded for such a small ""quality"" (a secret of moderate importance) was seen as a ""terrible dispatch"". Gloucester notes that the ""Duke"" would be blamed for this action, but as that is not explicitly taken from the question, and the Duke of Albany answers Passage 8 with the question. Passage 6, spoken ""aside"" to Gloucester, suggests that the people of a ""due resolution"" can make the leader lead the blind due to the plague of the times. Passage 7 suggests that Edgar (the illegitimate son and half-brother of Edgar) may be seen as culpable through the phrase ""madmen lead the blind."" However, this passage is more focused on Edgar's perspective, but we can infer from his own character that Edmund is responsible."

Regan is motivated by a desire to protect her own interests and power, while Gloucester poses a threat to her status and influence. Edmund's motivation is likely driven by a desire for power and revenge against his father, as revealed in Passage 6: ""They kill us for their sport."" This suggests that he sees Gloucester's life as a means of getting closer to power, rather than as a moral or family obligation. Lear's own actions have also contributed to Gloucester's downfall, as seen in Passage 10, where Lear innocently asks ""What, with the case of eyes?"" unaware of Gloucester's fate.

(""They kill us for their sport,"") suggesting a callous disregard for anyone's life, including Gloucester's. Edmund's true intentions are revealed in Passage 3, ""What needed then that terrible dispatch of it into your pocket?"" implying a sense of spite and malice. Passage 1 also highlights Edmund's involvement and Gloucester's shock, ""Confin'd to exhibition? All this done Upon the gad?"" indicating an unnatural and violent act.

Edgar implies that others, including the Duke, may also bear responsibility for Gloucester's blinding in Passage 6, but it is Edmund who is the primary instigator and executioner.

3	f	10	It is Edmund, Lear's illegitimate son, who is responsible for blinding Gloucester, and his motivation stems from his desire for revenge and self-interest. His actions are driven by a desire to avenge himself against his older half-brother Edgar and to gain favor with his stepmother, Goneril. As evidenced in Passage 2, Edmund justifies his treachery by questioning the value of Gloucester's reputation, demonstrating his callous and unfeeling nature. Additionally, in Passage 3, Gloucester himself suspects that Edmund's involvement is linked to the Duke, but Edmund's true intentions and actions reveal his culpability. He is able to carry out his plan with ease, as seen in Passage 6, where he discusses the societal implications of the blind leading the blind without shame or remorse.

In Passage 3, Gloucester questions how his injury came to be, suspecting a ""terrible dispatch"" by Edmund, but also referencing the Duke as being to blame for the ill effects of his actions (l.13-14). This further implies Goneril and Regan's involvement, as their schemes are orchestrated through Edgar and carried out by Edgar. As seen in Passage 8, Albany expresses shock and sorrow at Gloucester's blindness, and Lear implies in Passage 10 that the act was carried out on a bet or a personal game, which were initially suggested by Edgar.

However, as stated in Passage 5, Gloucester suspects the duke, but it is left unclear whether he is truly responsible. The actual perpetrator is Edmund, driven by a desire for power and revenge, as Edgar notes in a side comment after Gloucester's blinding, ""They kill us for their sport"" (Passage 6).

From Passage 2, we can see that Gloucester himself suspects that Edmund is responsible for the plot against him: ""What needed then that terrible dispatch of it into your pocket?"" The quality of nothing hath not such need to hide itself."" Gloucester implies that the reason for his blinded is a mere excuse for deceit, not a genuine concern for hiding something. In Passage 4, Gloucester reveals that he is already aware that the reason for his blinding is a ruse, indicating that he suspects Regan and Edmunds involvement: ""I would unstate myself to be in a due resolution."" This is further evidenced in Passage 8, where Albany questions whether Gloucester has lost the other eye, to which Gloucester responds with a despairing ""Alack, I have no eyes!""

3	f	22	"Edmund is responsible for blinding Gloucester. His motivation is his self-interest and loyalty to his friend, Edmund suggests that Gloucester did not take sufficient care to protect his papers, which were used in the revelation of his bastard son, Edmund's, true parentage. According to Passage 2, this leads Edmund to assert ""The quality of nothing hath not such need to hide itself."" (Act 2, Scene 1). Edmund's treachery is motivated by a desire for wealth and power, rather than a specific grudge against Gloucester. Passage 3, in which Gloucester asks ""When came this to you? Who brought it?"" offers a nod to the circumstances of the letter's revelation, suggesting that Edmund may have orchestrated its delivery. Edgar, Gloucester's legitimate son, suspects the King and Gloucester of plotting against him, though his own brother, Edmund, committed this act. Passage 6 supports Edgar's suspicion in that he says ""They kill us for their sport."" This reflects the King's reckless and violent tendencies, evident in other parts of the play, which contribute to Gloucester's fall. Ultimately, Edmund's blinding of Gloucester is a plot point driven by his own self-interest and his desire to eliminate an obstacle to his inheritance, as exemplified by Passages 4 and 5. ""I would unstate myself to be in a due resolution."" is a particularly telling line, suggesting Edmund's callous disregard for others.

Edmund delivers to Gloucester a letter that prompts his downfall, saying ""What needed then that terrible dispatch of it into your pocket? The quality of nothing hath not such need to hide itself"" (Passage 2). Gloucester is led to believe that the letter contains news of his illegitimate son Edgar's attempt to assassinate him, which ultimately leads to the blinding.

His motivation is rooted in jealousy and a desire for revenge, as evident from Passage 1 where Gloucester is confined and Edmund ponders, but does not reveal his guilt. The suggestion that Gloucester needs to hide the ""quality of nothing"" implies that Edmund recognizes Gloucester's innocence and seeks to exploit the old man's trusting nature for his own gain, as suggested in Passage 2. Passage 4, ""I would unstate myself to be in a due resolution,"" implies that Gloucester is trying to retract his words because he discovers Edmund's treachery. The Duke is initially implicated in Gloucester's downfall, as inferred from Passage 5, where it is said the Duke ""is to blame in this,"" but it seems unlikely that he had a direct role in blinding Gloucester. Edmund's true role in blinding Gloucester is explicitly stated later in the play, when the king learns that Edmund is responsible, but the motivation behind the act is a desire to remove Gloucester as a guardian to his son Edgar, allowing Edmund to continue his deception and gain power, which is not directly evident in the provided passages but supported by the overall context of the play. However, Passage 8 indicates that some characters think Gloucester was blinded by others, likely as a way to silence him after he discovered Edgar's plan, which reinforces this interpretation.

Edgar's role in blinding Gloucester is a morally reprehensible act and one that demonstrates the chaos and destructive consequences of unchecked ambition and the breakdown of family relations, as reflected in Gloucester's cries of ""They kill us for their sport"" (I.ii.134)."

Edmund says, ""This action of mine, how cruel so ever it is, will be taken by the reader as a demonstration that there is 'time's plague when madmen lead the blind'"" (1.2.135-136). He does not care about the harm this will cause his father or the family as a whole.

Edmund's motivation for blinding Gloucester is likely a desire to conceal the fact that he is Gloucester's illegitimate son, as Gloucester's legitimate son Edgar had cut off his own hair, deceiving both the Duke and Gloucester into believing him to be mad. The passage ""Gloucester: Confin'd to exhibition? All this done Upon the gad?"" (Passage 1) suggests that Gloucester is aware of the circumstances surrounding the blinding, and is questioning Edmund's actions. This implies that Edmund is responsible for Gloucester's current state. Edmund's response, ""What needed then that terrible dispatch of it into your pocket?"" (Passage 2), reveals his callous and cold calculation in blinding Gloucester. This shows that he is motivated by a desire to eliminate any obstacles to his scheme to claim the Duchess's property and titles. Furthermore, Gloucester's response in Passage 8, ""Alack, I have no eyes!"", and Lear's reaction, ""Read. Gloucester: What, with the case of eyes?""

Edmund's ""terrible dispatch"" (Passage 2: ""The quality of nothing hath not such need to hide itself"") suggests that he intended to conceal a birth defect or imperfection, which is later revealed to be the fact that Gloucester's youngest son Edgar is illegitimate, making the eldest Edmund the true heir to the earldom. Passage 3 (""What needed then that terrible dispatch of it into your pocket?"") implies that Edmund's actions are sneaky and clandestine, further hinting at his culpability in Gloucester's blinding. Passage 7 (""Tis the time's plague when madmen lead the blind"") suggests that the societal pressure to present a perfect image or ""hide"" one's imperfections can lead to chaos and instability, which may be Edmund's motivation for blinding Gloucester.

However, based on context and knowledge of the play, I can provide an answer. The responsibility for blinding Gloucester lies with Edmund, driven by his desire for revenge and his own advantage. Edmund is Gloucester's illegitimate son, and his actions reflect his resentment towards his father and his legitimate brother Edgar. In Passage 1, Gloucester learns from Edmund that his son Edgar has been driven mad, indicating that Edmund may have played a role in his downfall. In light of Edgar's actions, Gloucester's statement in Passage 2 implies that Edgar's behavior was the catalyst for Gloucester's downfall. Gloucester's confusion and sense of shame suggest that something happened to him, but by the time he seeks explanation, the damage has already been done. The exact reason for Gloucester's blinding is left somewhat ambiguous, but it is clear that someone is responsible for his suffering, with Edmund suspected of taking advantage of his father's vulnerability. The most damning evidence, however, comes from Gloucester's own realization that, as stated in Passage 9, ""I have no eyes...Is wretchedness depriv'd that benefit / To end itself by death?""

Her realization that her actions and intentions are being misunderstood and mocked leads to her emotional collapse. Regan and Goneril are directly responsible for Cordelia's emotional demise, as they fuel their father's rage and rejection of Cordelia. In Passage 2, Regan seems to mock Cordelia as she speaks of Lear's favor, driving a wedge further between the king and his youngest daughter. Lear's realization of Cordelia's death is a tragic consequence of his own actions, as witnessed in Passage 9, where he exclaims, ""When did you die?"" and Cordelia responds ""Still, still, far wide!""

Here, she indicates that she cannot feign affection, instead speaking the truth as she knows it - although it will cost her dearly. In contrast, her sisters' declarations, such as Goneril's ""I love you more then words can wield matter, / More then pen can write"" (1.1.57-58), only serve to demonstrate their insincerity and superficiality. However, it's worth noting that Cordelia's response is not just a rejection of Lear's demand, but also a reflection of the societal norms and expectations that restrict a woman's ability to express herself independently.

When Lear states, ""Know their value"" to them, Cordelia boldly states, ""I love you most."" (I.1.85). This is a simple statement, but one that stands in stark contrast to the ornate declarations of vanity that fill the conversation. Lear finds her response distasteful and interprets it as a sign of disdain, responding, ""Do you smell a man in the speech?""

In his rejection of her, Lear sets in motion the chaos that follows, testing the mettle of both his own family and society at large.

This simple yet powerful response highlights her commitment to truthfulness over empty praise. Later, in Act 1, Scene 1, when Lear asks her to flatter him with words of exaggerated affection, Cordelia refuses, saying: ""Love and be silent (134-135). No. This won't do.""

Cordelia's response is also a contrast to Goneril's and Regan's fawning declarations, which are actually a display of their own self-interest and cunning.

In the scene, Cordelia is aware of her father's moods and her words are cautious to not provoke his wrath.

While the exact last scene in which the Fool appears is not specified, it is most likely after Act III, Scene 6. In Act III, Scene 6, Lear meets the Fool in a cave outside of the huts of the naked women: ""O, woe awaits thee; late and soon shalt thou find it. (55) In the hollow, hollow wise men are Assassins from the edge of a precipice!"" (56-57) The Fool's warning only strengthens Lear's resolve to ""untie the knotted mettle of his heart"" that he feels has turned into a monstrous creature, yet the image sticks with him long after the Fool's final, seemingly obscure words fade into darkness."

Lear orders the Fool ""Into the Boar's head"" where his life ""should'st go too, / Yea, to th' last"" (4.1.21-22). With this departure, the Fool vanishes, marking an exit that mirrors Lear's own downfall. Other instances of the Fool's presence show his significant connection to Lear's emotional journeys; in Act 1, Scene 4, Lear says, ""O, ho, unravel me the best way I can"" (1.4.54) but the Fool's interpretation of the knave's cryptic behavior suggests a deeper meaning for the aging king, demonstrating the character's profound impact on Lear's psyche. The final appearance is fitting as it occurs just after Lear has been dispossessed of his kingdom and exposed to the harsh realities of life and power politics outside his court. As the only character able to speak directly to Lear while questioning the monarch's judgment and wisdom, it is reasonable to expect his absence marks the decline of Lear's decision-making and an emergence of his instability. This is seen when Lear says, ""Out, vile, usurping fiends!"" to his followers who will soon turn on him (4.1.15)."	Baseline	What is the last scene in which the Fool appears?	0

This line suggests that the Fool's wit and mirth may be more relevant in the play's earlier stages, and that he may not be seen in the final scene.

As Lear's madness grows, the Fool's wisdom and humanity pierce through the noise of the other characters to offer a poignant commentary: ""Thou wouldst be angry, if the roastcheeks would keep the court at bay. Thin gold in the nursery!"" The Fool's presence is marked by lines such as ""I'll go to Dover do"" in Act 3, Scene 6, where he sets off on his own journey, leaving the chaos and betrayal of Edgar's betrayal to unfold without him.

This passage highlights the Fool's emotional turmoil and concern for his master's family dynamics.

He takes it into his head he can say this of himself! If so, he has he not another tongue?"" Additionally, this final appearance highlights the Fool's observation of the Goneril and Regan's marriage, a union that has resulted in their mutual manipulation of Lear and a display of the very same manipulation techniques that Lear himself employed earlier in the play (3.6.102-104): ""O cursed sor row.

This exchange occurs after Lear has disowned Cordelia, and before Lear's own realization of his tragic mistakes. Before his exit, the Fool had been a faithful companion to Lear and offered counsel in the earlier acts. However, although a comical figure, his speech offers insights and warnings to Lear, particularly in Act 1, Scene 4 where he says, ""This curse I melt, excepting thee, thou centre of / My eyeballs and my heart, even I will die with thee, / Drink all, eat all, / Sleep more, she lives to see / All dear friends in hire of friends"" (1.4.154-158)."

However, shortly after, the Fool disappears, and Lear is taken into captivity by the Regan's forces. It is not until after the events of the play are resolved, Cordelia has taken the throne, and Kent has been imprisoned, that Lear is finally allowed to be reunited with Cordelia, suggesting the Fool's presence is necessary for Lear's emotional turmoil, but ultimately, their functions have been fulfilled after this final scene."

The Fool's absence is notable when Lear asks, ""Thou think'st thy knavish speech stands on the order / Of right?"" (5.3.19-20), no longer receiving the Fool's witty ripostes. Lear becomes ""more fully disenchanted"" (5.3.160), and from this point on, his character is described less by his responses to the Fool's words.

This part of the play is an important turning point in their relationship. ""I will go to the King; even to his own doors, after him"" (3.6.81). However, this decision may be a fantasy, as the Fool reenters only to become a tragic figure himself, consumed by the very corruption he criticized.

This is in reference to the old man who was seen crying for their parricide (their children) but their cap being on (their head being covered) meaning being ignorant or foolish about what happening to them.

This observation underscores Lear's own helplessness and poverty, stripped of his royal power and dignity. Shakespeare emphasizes the Fool's wit and insight when Lear, enraged, orders, ""A plague upon thee, frowney'd agate!"" to which the Fool responds, ""I'll bear it like a man, though I be my father's, or so I'd have him wed her."" These lines convey the Fool's sharp humor and his determination to defy Lear's wrath.

As the Fool is chased by Edmund's henchmen, he laments, ""The wheel is come full circle: I am here"" (5.3.175), highlighting the tragic irony of his own downfall, and demonstrating the cyclical nature of violence and suffering in the play. Interestingly, the Fool's final words are: ""I'll leave with her, (and here he weeps) 0, I am all as faulty / As her father was, and her mother"" (5.3.183-184), underscoring the parallels between the Fool's fate and that of Lear's family, who have all fallen prey to the treacherous Edmund's machinations."

This contrast highlights Lear's descent from grandeur to sorrow. Additionally, Lear's response reveals his dwindling grasp of reality, showing that the Fool's statement effectively marks a turning point in Lear's downward spiral. Later, the Fool is mentioned in Act 5, Scene 3 as having been beaten by Oswald, but his final appearance as a character comes before this and is notable for its poignancy and insight.

This brief appearance is characteristic of the Fool's overall limited role in the play. He is seen arguing with Lear over the future king's own daughters and predicting their fates. As Lear's behavior becomes increasingly erratic and cruel, the Fool is no longer needed to provide commentary and criticism.

This situation creates a sense of chaos and confusion that contributes to the tragic outcome. Cordelia dies in the storm scene, Act 3, Scene 2, which is described as follows: ""No blow hath attended me"" (3.2.7) where her death is implied as she cannot withstand the emotional weight of her father's rejection and the harsh environment around her.

This can be inferred from the passage ""The weight of this teaching has this Forrest bore, / And let he go free"" (Act 5, Scene 3), suggesting the weight of grief has been crushing her. However, the actual instrument of death is starvation and exposure, as described by the Gentleman ""He is gone, indeed; he has been, and's returned / To his bed of burning feathers there to feel"" (Act 5, Scene 3).

Her sister Regan reveals that Goneril and she are responsible for her imprisonment (Act 3, Scene 2), which is a key moment in her emotional decline. Ultimately, Cordelia dies from a direct result of Lear's actions and the effects of a society that refuses to value her love and loyalty.

However, it is not Lear who is directly responsible for her death, but rather Edmund, the illegitimate son of the Earl of Gloucester.

Edmund's treachery is a direct consequence of his own actions: ""What need you suffer under sharp looks?"" Cordelia says before her execution, and yet Lear had earlier turned his children against each other (Act 3, Scene 4).

Lear ""cries for Cordelia"" while she is led off to prison, and, upon learning that she has been hanged, he pronounces that ""Blow, winds, and crack your cheeks!"" and disobeys the command that he is supposed to live out his days ""in misery,"" indicating the depth of his emotional pain (""Act 5, Scene 3"").
