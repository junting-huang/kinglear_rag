I	I	King Lear's Palace	STAGE	1	"Enter Kent, Gloucester, and Edmund. [Kent and Gloucester converse. Edmund stands back.]"
I	I	King Lear's Palace	Kent	2	I thought the King had more affected the Duke of Albany than Cornwall.
I	I	King Lear's Palace	Gloucester	3	"It did always seem so to us; but now, in the division of the kingdom, it appears not which of the Dukes he values most, for equalities are so weigh'd that curiosity in neither can make choice of either's moiety."
I	I	King Lear's Palace	Kent	4	"Is not this your son, my lord?"
I	I	King Lear's Palace	Gloucester	5	"His breeding, sir, hath been at my charge. I have so often blush'd to acknowledge him that now I am braz'd to't."
I	I	King Lear's Palace	Kent	6	I cannot conceive you.
I	I	King Lear's Palace	Gloucester	7	"Sir, this young fellow's mother could; whereupon she grew round-womb'd, and had indeed, sir, a son for her cradle ere she had a husband for her bed. Do you smell a fault?"
I	I	King Lear's Palace	Kent	8	"I cannot wish the fault undone, the issue of it being so proper."
I	I	King Lear's Palace	Gloucester	9	"But I have, sir, a son by order of law, some year elder than this, who yet is no dearer in my account. Though this knave came something saucily into the world before he was sent for, yet was his mother fair, there was good sport at his making, and the whoreson must be acknowledged.- Do you know this noble gentleman, Edmund?"
I	I	King Lear's Palace	Edmund	10	"No, my lord."
I	I	King Lear's Palace	Gloucester	11	My Lord of Kent. Remember him hereafter as my honourable friend.
I	I	King Lear's Palace	Edmund	12	My services to your lordship.
I	I	King Lear's Palace	Kent	13	"I must love you, and sue to know you better."
I	I	King Lear's Palace	Edmund	14	"Sir, I shall study deserving."
I	I	King Lear's Palace	Gloucester	15	"He hath been out nine years, and away he shall again. Sound a sennet. The King is coming."
I	I	King Lear's Palace	STAGE	16	"Enter one bearing a coronet; then Lear; then the Dukes of Albany and Cornwall; next, Goneril, Regan, Cordelia, with Followers."
I	I	King Lear's Palace	Lear	17	"Attend the lords of France and Burgundy, Gloucester."
I	I	King Lear's Palace	Gloucester	18	"I shall, my liege."
I	I	King Lear's Palace	STAGE	19	Exeunt [Gloucester and Edmund].
I	I	King Lear's Palace	Lear	20	"Meantime we shall express our darker purpose. Give me the map there. Know we have divided In three our kingdom; and 'tis our fast intent To shake all cares and business from our age, Conferring them on younger strengths while we Unburthen'd crawl toward death. Our son of Cornwall, And you, our no less loving son of Albany, We have this hour a constant will to publish Our daughters' several dowers, that future strife May be prevented now. The princes, France and Burgundy, Great rivals in our youngest daughter's love, Long in our court have made their amorous sojourn, And here are to be answer'd. Tell me, my daughters (Since now we will divest us both of rule, Interest of territory, cares of state), Which of you shall we say doth love us most? That we our largest bounty may extend Where nature doth with merit challenge. Goneril, Our eldest-born, speak first."
I	I	King Lear's Palace	Goneril	21	"Sir, I love you more than words can wield the matter; Dearer than eyesight, space, and liberty; Beyond what can be valued, rich or rare; No less than life, with grace, health, beauty, honour; As much as child e'er lov'd, or father found; A love that makes breath poor, and speech unable. Beyond all manner of so much I love you."
I	I	King Lear's Palace	Cordelia	22	"[aside] What shall Cordelia speak? Love, and be silent."
I	I	King Lear's Palace	Lear	23	"Of all these bounds, even from this line to this, With shadowy forests and with champains rich'd, With plenteous rivers and wide-skirted meads, We make thee lady. To thine and Albany's issue Be this perpetual.- What says our second daughter, Our dearest Regan, wife to Cornwall? Speak."
I	I	King Lear's Palace	Regan	24	"Sir, I am made Of the selfsame metal that my sister is, And prize me at her worth. In my true heart I find she names my very deed of love; Only she comes too short, that I profess Myself an enemy to all other joys Which the most precious square of sense possesses, And find I am alone felicitate In your dear Highness' love."
I	I	King Lear's Palace	Cordelia	25	[aside] Then poor Cordelia! And yet not so; since I am sure my love's More richer than my tongue.
I	I	King Lear's Palace	Lear	26	"To thee and thine hereditary ever Remain this ample third of our fair kingdom, No less in space, validity, and pleasure Than that conferr'd on Goneril.- Now, our joy, Although the last, not least; to whose young love The vines of France and milk of Burgundy Strive to be interest; what can you say to draw A third more opulent than your sisters? Speak."
I	I	King Lear's Palace	Cordelia	27	"Nothing, my lord."
I	I	King Lear's Palace	Lear	28	Nothing?
I	I	King Lear's Palace	Cordelia	29	Nothing.
I	I	King Lear's Palace	Lear	30	Nothing can come of nothing. Speak again.
I	I	King Lear's Palace	Cordelia	31	"Unhappy that I am, I cannot heave My heart into my mouth. I love your Majesty According to my bond; no more nor less."
I	I	King Lear's Palace	Lear	32	"How, how, Cordelia? Mend your speech a little, Lest it may mar your fortunes."
I	I	King Lear's Palace	Cordelia	33	"Good my lord, You have begot me, bred me, lov'd me; I Return those duties back as are right fit, Obey you, love you, and most honour you. Why have my sisters husbands, if they say They love you all? Haply, when I shall wed, That lord whose hand must take my plight shall carry Half my love with him, half my care and duty. Sure I shall never marry like my sisters, To love my father all."
I	I	King Lear's Palace	Lear	34	But goes thy heart with this?
I	I	King Lear's Palace	Cordelia	35	"Ay, good my lord."
I	I	King Lear's Palace	Lear	36	"So young, and so untender?"
I	I	King Lear's Palace	Cordelia	37	"So young, my lord, and true."
I	I	King Lear's Palace	Lear	38	"Let it be so! thy truth then be thy dower! For, by the sacred radiance of the sun, The mysteries of Hecate and the night; By all the operation of the orbs From whom we do exist and cease to be; Here I disclaim all my paternal care, Propinquity and property of blood, And as a stranger to my heart and me Hold thee from this for ever. The barbarous Scythian, Or he that makes his generation messes To gorge his appetite, shall to my bosom Be as well neighbour'd, pitied, and reliev'd, As thou my sometime daughter."
I	I	King Lear's Palace	Kent	39	Good my liege-
I	I	King Lear's Palace	Lear	40	"Peace, Kent! Come not between the dragon and his wrath. I lov'd her most, and thought to set my rest On her kind nursery.- Hence and avoid my sight!- So be my grave my peace as here I give Her father's heart from her! Call France! Who stirs? Call Burgundy! Cornwall and Albany, With my two daughters' dowers digest this third; Let pride, which she calls plainness, marry her. I do invest you jointly in my power, Preeminence, and all the large effects That troop with majesty. Ourself, by monthly course, With reservation of an hundred knights, By you to be sustain'd, shall our abode Make with you by due turns. Only we still retain The name, and all th' additions to a king. The sway, Revenue, execution of the rest, Beloved sons, be yours; which to confirm, This coronet part betwixt you."
I	I	King Lear's Palace	Kent	41	"Royal Lear, Whom I have ever honour'd as my king, Lov'd as my father, as my master follow'd, As my great patron thought on in my prayers-"
I	I	King Lear's Palace	Lear	42	The bow is bent and drawn; make from the shaft.
I	I	King Lear's Palace	Kent	43	"Let it fall rather, though the fork invade The region of my heart! Be Kent unmannerly When Lear is mad. What wouldst thou do, old man? Think'st thou that duty shall have dread to speak When power to flattery bows? To plainness honour's bound When majesty falls to folly. Reverse thy doom; And in thy best consideration check This hideous rashness. Answer my life my judgment, Thy youngest daughter does not love thee least, Nor are those empty-hearted whose low sound Reverbs no hollowness."
I	I	King Lear's Palace	Lear	44	"Kent, on thy life, no more!"
I	I	King Lear's Palace	Kent	45	"My life I never held but as a pawn To wage against thine enemies; nor fear to lose it, Thy safety being the motive."
I	I	King Lear's Palace	Lear	46	Out of my sight!
I	I	King Lear's Palace	Kent	47	"See better, Lear, and let me still remain The true blank of thine eye."
I	I	King Lear's Palace	Lear	48	Now by Apollo-
I	I	King Lear's Palace	Kent	49	"Now by Apollo, King, Thou swear'st thy gods in vain."
I	I	King Lear's Palace	Lear	50	O vassal! miscreant! [Lays his hand on his sword.]
I	I	King Lear's Palace	Albany	51	"Dear sir, forbear!"
I	I	King Lear's Palace	Cornwall	52	"Dear sir, forbear!"
I	I	King Lear's Palace	Kent	53	"Do! Kill thy physician, and the fee bestow Upon the foul disease. Revoke thy gift, Or, whilst I can vent clamour from my throat, I'll tell thee thou dost evil."
I	I	King Lear's Palace	Lear	54	"Hear me, recreant! On thine allegiance, hear me! Since thou hast sought to make us break our vow- Which we durst never yet- and with strain'd pride To come between our sentence and our power,- Which nor our nature nor our place can bear,- Our potency made good, take thy reward. Five days we do allot thee for provision To shield thee from diseases of the world, And on the sixth to turn thy hated back Upon our kingdom. If, on the tenth day following, Thy banish'd trunk be found in our dominions, The moment is thy death. Away! By Jupiter, This shall not be revok'd."
I	I	King Lear's Palace	Kent	55	"Fare thee well, King. Since thus thou wilt appear, Freedom lives hence, and banishment is here. [To Cordelia] The gods to their dear shelter take thee, maid, That justly think'st and hast most rightly said! [To Regan and Goneril] And your large speeches may your deeds approve, That good effects may spring from words of love. Thus Kent, O princes, bids you all adieu; He'll shape his old course in a country new."
I	I	King Lear's Palace	STAGE	56	Exit.
I	I	King Lear's Palace	STAGE	57	"Flourish. Enter Gloucester, with France and Burgundy; Attendants."
I	I	King Lear's Palace	Gloucester	58	"Here's France and Burgundy, my noble lord."
I	I	King Lear's Palace	Lear	59	"My Lord of Burgundy, We first address toward you, who with this king Hath rivall'd for our daughter. What in the least Will you require in present dower with her, Or cease your quest of love?"
I	I	King Lear's Palace	Burgundy	60	"Most royal Majesty, I crave no more than hath your Highness offer'd, Nor will you tender less."
I	I	King Lear's Palace	Lear	61	"Right noble Burgundy, When she was dear to us, we did hold her so; But now her price is fall'n. Sir, there she stands. If aught within that little seeming substance, Or all of it, with our displeasure piec'd, And nothing more, may fitly like your Grace, She's there, and she is yours."
I	I	King Lear's Palace	Burgundy	62	I know no answer.
I	I	King Lear's Palace	Lear	63	"Will you, with those infirmities she owes, Unfriended, new adopted to our hate, Dow'r'd with our curse, and stranger'd with our oath, Take her, or leave her?"
I	I	King Lear's Palace	Burgundy	64	"Pardon me, royal sir. Election makes not up on such conditions."
I	I	King Lear's Palace	Lear	65	"Then leave her, sir; for, by the pow'r that made me, I tell you all her wealth. [To France] For you, great King, I would not from your love make such a stray To match you where I hate; therefore beseech you T' avert your liking a more worthier way Than on a wretch whom nature is asham'd Almost t' acknowledge hers."
I	I	King Lear's Palace	France	66	"This is most strange, That she that even but now was your best object, The argument of your praise, balm of your age, Most best, most dearest, should in this trice of time Commit a thing so monstrous to dismantle So many folds of favour. Sure her offence Must be of such unnatural degree That monsters it, or your fore-vouch'd affection Fall'n into taint; which to believe of her Must be a faith that reason without miracle Should never plant in me."
I	I	King Lear's Palace	Cordelia	67	"I yet beseech your Majesty, If for I want that glib and oily art To speak and purpose not, since what I well intend, I'll do't before I speak- that you make known It is no vicious blot, murther, or foulness, No unchaste action or dishonoured step, That hath depriv'd me of your grace and favour; But even for want of that for which I am richer- A still-soliciting eye, and such a tongue As I am glad I have not, though not to have it Hath lost me in your liking."
I	I	King Lear's Palace	Lear	68	Better thou Hadst not been born than not t' have pleas'd me better.
I	I	King Lear's Palace	France	69	"Is it but this- a tardiness in nature Which often leaves the history unspoke That it intends to do? My Lord of Burgundy, What say you to the lady? Love's not love When it is mingled with regards that stands Aloof from th' entire point. Will you have her? She is herself a dowry."
I	I	King Lear's Palace	Burgundy	70	"Royal Lear, Give but that portion which yourself propos'd, And here I take Cordelia by the hand, Duchess of Burgundy."
I	I	King Lear's Palace	Lear	71	Nothing! I have sworn; I am firm.
I	I	King Lear's Palace	Burgundy	72	I am sorry then you have so lost a father That you must lose a husband.
I	I	King Lear's Palace	Cordelia	73	"Peace be with Burgundy! Since that respects of fortune are his love, I shall not be his wife."
I	I	King Lear's Palace	France	74	"Fairest Cordelia, that art most rich, being poor; Most choice, forsaken; and most lov'd, despis'd! Thee and thy virtues here I seize upon. Be it lawful I take up what's cast away. Gods, gods! 'tis strange that from their cold'st neglect My love should kindle to inflam'd respect. Thy dow'rless daughter, King, thrown to my chance, Is queen of us, of ours, and our fair France. Not all the dukes in wat'rish Burgundy Can buy this unpriz'd precious maid of me. Bid them farewell, Cordelia, though unkind. Thou losest here, a better where to find."
I	I	King Lear's Palace	Lear	75	"Thou hast her, France; let her be thine; for we Have no such daughter, nor shall ever see That face of hers again. Therefore be gone Without our grace, our love, our benison. Come, noble Burgundy."
I	I	King Lear's Palace	STAGE	76	"Flourish. Exeunt Lear, Burgundy, [Cornwall, Albany, Gloucester, and Attendants]."
I	I	King Lear's Palace	France	77	Bid farewell to your sisters.
I	I	King Lear's Palace	Cordelia	78	"The jewels of our father, with wash'd eyes Cordelia leaves you. I know you what you are; And, like a sister, am most loath to call Your faults as they are nam'd. Use well our father. To your professed bosoms I commit him; But yet, alas, stood I within his grace, I would prefer him to a better place! So farewell to you both."
I	I	King Lear's Palace	Goneril	79	Prescribe not us our duties.
I	I	King Lear's Palace	Regan	80	"Let your study Be to content your lord, who hath receiv'd you At fortune's alms. You have obedience scanted, And well are worth the want that you have wanted."
I	I	King Lear's Palace	Cordelia	81	"Time shall unfold what plighted cunning hides. Who cover faults, at last shame them derides. Well may you prosper!"
I	I	King Lear's Palace	France	82	"Come, my fair Cordelia."
I	I	King Lear's Palace	STAGE	83	Exeunt France and Cordelia.
I	I	King Lear's Palace	Goneril	84	"Sister, it is not little I have to say of what most nearly appertains to us both. I think our father will hence to-night."
I	I	King Lear's Palace	Regan	85	"That's most certain, and with you; next month with us."
I	I	King Lear's Palace	Goneril	86	"You see how full of changes his age is. The observation we have made of it hath not been little. He always lov'd our sister most, and with what poor judgment he hath now cast her off appears too grossly."
I	I	King Lear's Palace	Regan	87	'Tis the infirmity of his age; yet he hath ever but slenderly known himself.
I	I	King Lear's Palace	Goneril	88	"The best and soundest of his time hath been but rash; then must we look to receive from his age, not alone the imperfections of long-ingraffed condition, but therewithal the unruly waywardness that infirm and choleric years bring with them."
I	I	King Lear's Palace	Regan	89	Such unconstant starts are we like to have from him as this of Kent's banishment.
I	I	King Lear's Palace	Goneril	90	"There is further compliment of leave-taking between France and him. Pray you let's hit together. If our father carry authority with such dispositions as he bears, this last surrender of his will but offend us."
I	I	King Lear's Palace	Regan	91	We shall further think on't.
I	I	King Lear's Palace	Goneril	92	"We must do something, and i' th' heat."
I	I	King Lear's Palace	STAGE	93	Exeunt.
I	II	The Earl of Gloucester's Castle	STAGE	1	"Enter [Edmund the] Bastard solus, [with a letter]."
I	II	The Earl of Gloucester's Castle	Edmund	2	"Thou, Nature, art my goddess; to thy law My services are bound. Wherefore should I Stand in the plague of custom, and permit The curiosity of nations to deprive me, For that I am some twelve or fourteen moonshines Lag of a brother? Why bastard? wherefore base? When my dimensions are as well compact, My mind as generous, and my shape as true, As honest madam's issue? Why brand they us With base? with baseness? bastardy? base, base? Who, in the lusty stealth of nature, take More composition and fierce quality Than doth, within a dull, stale, tired bed, Go to th' creating a whole tribe of fops Got 'tween asleep and wake? Well then, Legitimate Edgar, I must have your land. Our father's love is to the bastard Edmund As to th' legitimate. Fine word- 'legitimate'! Well, my legitimate, if this letter speed, And my invention thrive, Edmund the base Shall top th' legitimate. I grow; I prosper. Now, gods, stand up for bastards!"
I	II	The Earl of Gloucester's Castle	STAGE	3	Enter Gloucester.
I	II	The Earl of Gloucester's Castle	Gloucester	4	"Kent banish'd thus? and France in choler parted? And the King gone to-night? subscrib'd his pow'r? Confin'd to exhibition? All this done Upon the gad? Edmund, how now? What news?"
I	II	The Earl of Gloucester's Castle	Edmund	5	"So please your lordship, none. [Puts up the letter.]"
I	II	The Earl of Gloucester's Castle	Gloucester	6	Why so earnestly seek you to put up that letter?
I	II	The Earl of Gloucester's Castle	Edmund	7	"I know no news, my lord."
I	II	The Earl of Gloucester's Castle	Gloucester	8	What paper were you reading?
I	II	The Earl of Gloucester's Castle	Edmund	9	"Nothing, my lord."
I	II	The Earl of Gloucester's Castle	Gloucester	10	"No? What needed then that terrible dispatch of it into your pocket? The quality of nothing hath not such need to hide itself. Let's see. Come, if it be nothing, I shall not need spectacles."
I	II	The Earl of Gloucester's Castle	Edmund	11	"I beseech you, sir, pardon me. It is a letter from my brother that I have not all o'er-read; and for so much as I have perus'd, I find it not fit for your o'erlooking."
I	II	The Earl of Gloucester's Castle	Gloucester	12	"Give me the letter, sir."
I	II	The Earl of Gloucester's Castle	Edmund	13	"I shall offend, either to detain or give it. The contents, as in part I understand them, are to blame."
I	II	The Earl of Gloucester's Castle	Gloucester	14	"Let's see, let's see!"
I	II	The Earl of Gloucester's Castle	Edmund	15	"I hope, for my brother's justification, he wrote this but as an essay or taste of my virtue."
I	II	The Earl of Gloucester's Castle	Gloucester	16	"(reads) 'This policy and reverence of age makes the world bitter to the best of our times; keeps our fortunes from us till our oldness cannot relish them. I begin to find an idle and fond bondage in the oppression of aged tyranny, who sways, not as it hath power, but as it is suffer'd. Come to me, that of this I may speak more. If our father would sleep till I wak'd him, you should enjoy half his revenue for ever, and live the beloved of your brother, 'EDGAR.' Hum! Conspiracy? 'Sleep till I wak'd him, you should enjoy half his revenue.' My son Edgar! Had he a hand to write this? a heart and brain to breed it in? When came this to you? Who brought it?"
I	II	The Earl of Gloucester's Castle	Edmund	17	"It was not brought me, my lord: there's the cunning of it. I found it thrown in at the casement of my closet."
I	II	The Earl of Gloucester's Castle	Gloucester	18	You know the character to be your brother's?
I	II	The Earl of Gloucester's Castle	Edmund	19	"If the matter were good, my lord, I durst swear it were his; but in respect of that, I would fain think it were not."
I	II	The Earl of Gloucester's Castle	Gloucester	20	It is his.
I	II	The Earl of Gloucester's Castle	Edmund	21	"It is his hand, my lord; but I hope his heart is not in the contents."
I	II	The Earl of Gloucester's Castle	Gloucester	22	Hath he never before sounded you in this business?
I	II	The Earl of Gloucester's Castle	Edmund	23	"Never, my lord. But I have heard him oft maintain it to be fit that, sons at perfect age, and fathers declining, the father should be as ward to the son, and the son manage his revenue."
I	II	The Earl of Gloucester's Castle	Gloucester	24	"O villain, villain! His very opinion in the letter! Abhorred villain! Unnatural, detested, brutish villain! worse than brutish! Go, sirrah, seek him. I'll apprehend him. Abominable villain! Where is he?"
I	II	The Earl of Gloucester's Castle	Edmund	25	"I do not well know, my lord. If it shall please you to suspend your indignation against my brother till you can derive from him better testimony of his intent, you should run a certain course; where, if you violently proceed against him, mistaking his purpose, it would make a great gap in your own honour and shake in pieces the heart of his obedience. I dare pawn down my life for him that he hath writ this to feel my affection to your honour, and to no other pretence of danger."
I	II	The Earl of Gloucester's Castle	Gloucester	26	Think you so?
I	II	The Earl of Gloucester's Castle	Edmund	27	"If your honour judge it meet, I will place you where you shall hear us confer of this and by an auricular assurance have your satisfaction, and that without any further delay than this very evening."
I	II	The Earl of Gloucester's Castle	Gloucester	28	He cannot be such a monster.
I	II	The Earl of Gloucester's Castle	Edmund	29	"Nor is not, sure."
I	II	The Earl of Gloucester's Castle	Gloucester	30	"To his father, that so tenderly and entirely loves him. Heaven and earth! Edmund, seek him out; wind me into him, I pray you; frame the business after your own wisdom. I would unstate myself to be in a due resolution."
I	II	The Earl of Gloucester's Castle	Edmund	31	"I will seek him, sir, presently; convey the business as I shall find means, and acquaint you withal."
I	II	The Earl of Gloucester's Castle	Gloucester	32	"These late eclipses in the sun and moon portend no good to us. Though the wisdom of nature can reason it thus and thus, yet nature finds itself scourg'd by the sequent effects. Love cools, friendship falls off, brothers divide. In cities, mutinies; in countries, discord; in palaces, treason; and the bond crack'd 'twixt son and father. This villain of mine comes under the prediction; there's son against father: the King falls from bias of nature; there's father against child. We have seen the best of our time. Machinations, hollowness, treachery, and all ruinous disorders follow us disquietly to our graves. Find out this villain, Edmund; it shall lose thee nothing; do it carefully. And the noble and true-hearted Kent banish'd! his offence, honesty! 'Tis strange."
I	II	The Earl of Gloucester's Castle	STAGE	33	Exit.
I	II	The Earl of Gloucester's Castle	Edmund	34	"This is the excellent foppery of the world, that, when we are sick in fortune, often the surfeit of our own behaviour, we make guilty of our disasters the sun, the moon, and the stars; as if we were villains on necessity; fools by heavenly compulsion; knaves, thieves, and treachers by spherical pre-dominance; drunkards, liars, and adulterers by an enforc'd obedience of planetary influence; and all that we are evil in, by a divine thrusting on. An admirable evasion of whore-master man, to lay his goatish disposition to the charge of a star! My father compounded with my mother under the Dragon's Tail, and my nativity was under Ursa Major, so that it follows I am rough and lecherous. Fut! I should have been that I am, had the maidenliest star in the firmament twinkled on my bastardizing. Edgar-"
I	II	The Earl of Gloucester's Castle	STAGE	35	Enter Edgar.
I	II	The Earl of Gloucester's Castle	Edmund	36	"and pat! he comes, like the catastrophe of the old comedy. My cue is villainous melancholy, with a sigh like Tom o' Bedlam. O, these eclipses do portend these divisions! Fa, sol, la, mi."
I	II	The Earl of Gloucester's Castle	Edgar	37	"How now, brother Edmund? What serious contemplation are you in?"
I	II	The Earl of Gloucester's Castle	Edmund	38	"I am thinking, brother, of a prediction I read this other day, what should follow these eclipses."
I	II	The Earl of Gloucester's Castle	Edgar	39	Do you busy yourself with that?
I	II	The Earl of Gloucester's Castle	Edmund	40	"I promise you, the effects he writes of succeed unhappily: as of unnaturalness between the child and the parent; death, dearth, dissolutions of ancient amities; divisions in state, menaces and maledictions against king and nobles; needless diffidences, banishment of friends, dissipation of cohorts, nuptial breaches, and I know not what."
I	II	The Earl of Gloucester's Castle	Edgar	41	How long have you been a sectary astronomical?
I	II	The Earl of Gloucester's Castle	Edmund	42	"Come, come! When saw you my father last?"
I	II	The Earl of Gloucester's Castle	Edgar	43	The night gone by.
I	II	The Earl of Gloucester's Castle	Edmund	44	Spake you with him?
I	II	The Earl of Gloucester's Castle	Edgar	45	"Ay, two hours together."
I	II	The Earl of Gloucester's Castle	Edmund	46	Parted you in good terms? Found you no displeasure in him by word or countenance?
I	II	The Earl of Gloucester's Castle	Edgar	47	None at all.
I	II	The Earl of Gloucester's Castle	Edmund	48	"Bethink yourself wherein you may have offended him; and at my entreaty forbear his presence until some little time hath qualified the heat of his displeasure, which at this instant so rageth in him that with the mischief of your person it would scarcely allay."
I	II	The Earl of Gloucester's Castle	Edgar	49	Some villain hath done me wrong.
I	II	The Earl of Gloucester's Castle	Edmund	50	"That's my fear. I pray you have a continent forbearance till the speed of his rage goes slower; and, as I say, retire with me to my lodging, from whence I will fitly bring you to hear my lord speak. Pray ye, go! There's my key. If you do stir abroad, go arm'd."
I	II	The Earl of Gloucester's Castle	Edgar	51	"Arm'd, brother?"
I	II	The Earl of Gloucester's Castle	Edmund	52	"Brother, I advise you to the best. Go arm'd. I am no honest man if there be any good meaning toward you. I have told you what I have seen and heard; but faintly, nothing like the image and horror of it. Pray you, away!"
I	II	The Earl of Gloucester's Castle	Edgar	53	Shall I hear from you anon?
I	II	The Earl of Gloucester's Castle	Edmund	54	I do serve you in this business.
I	II	The Earl of Gloucester's Castle	STAGE	55	Exit Edgar.
I	II	The Earl of Gloucester's Castle	Edmund	56	"A credulous father! and a brother noble, Whose nature is so far from doing harms That he suspects none; on whose foolish honesty My practices ride easy! I see the business. Let me, if not by birth, have lands by wit; All with me's meet that I can fashion fit."
I	II	The Earl of Gloucester's Castle	STAGE	57	Exit.
I	III	The Duke of Albany's Palace	STAGE	1	Enter Goneril and [her] Steward [Oswald].
I	III	The Duke of Albany's Palace	Goneril	2	Did my father strike my gentleman for chiding of his fool?
I	III	The Duke of Albany's Palace	Oswald	3	"Ay, madam."
I	III	The Duke of Albany's Palace	Goneril	4	"By day and night, he wrongs me! Every hour He flashes into one gross crime or other That sets us all at odds. I'll not endure it. His knights grow riotous, and himself upbraids us On every trifle. When he returns from hunting, I will not speak with him. Say I am sick. If you come slack of former services, You shall do well; the fault of it I'll answer."
I	III	The Duke of Albany's Palace	STAGE	5	[Horns within.]
I	III	The Duke of Albany's Palace	Oswald	6	"He's coming, madam; I hear him."
I	III	The Duke of Albany's Palace	Goneril	7	"Put on what weary negligence you please, You and your fellows. I'd have it come to question. If he distaste it, let him to our sister, Whose mind and mine I know in that are one, Not to be overrul'd. Idle old man, That still would manage those authorities That he hath given away! Now, by my life, Old fools are babes again, and must be us'd With checks as flatteries, when they are seen abus'd. Remember what I have said."
I	III	The Duke of Albany's Palace	Oswald	8	"Very well, madam."
I	III	The Duke of Albany's Palace	Goneril	9	"And let his knights have colder looks among you. What grows of it, no matter. Advise your fellows so. I would breed from hence occasions, and I shall, That I may speak. I'll write straight to my sister To hold my very course. Prepare for dinner."
I	III	The Duke of Albany's Palace	STAGE	10	Exeunt.
I	IV	The Duke of Albany's Palace	STAGE	1	"Enter Kent, [disguised]."
I	IV	The Duke of Albany's Palace	Kent	2	"If but as well I other accents borrow, That can my speech defuse, my good intent May carry through itself to that full issue For which I raz'd my likeness. Now, banish'd Kent, If thou canst serve where thou dost stand condemn'd, So may it come, thy master, whom thou lov'st, Shall find thee full of labours."
I	IV	The Duke of Albany's Palace	STAGE	3	"Horns within. Enter Lear, [Knights,] and Attendants."
I	IV	The Duke of Albany's Palace	Lear	4	Let me not stay a jot for dinner; go get it ready. [Exit an Attendant.] How now? What art thou?
I	IV	The Duke of Albany's Palace	Kent	5	"A man, sir."
I	IV	The Duke of Albany's Palace	Lear	6	What dost thou profess? What wouldst thou with us?
I	IV	The Duke of Albany's Palace	Kent	7	"I do profess to be no less than I seem, to serve him truly that will put me in trust, to love him that is honest, to converse with him that is wise and says little, to fear judgment, to fight when I cannot choose, and to eat no fish."
I	IV	The Duke of Albany's Palace	Lear	8	What art thou?
I	IV	The Duke of Albany's Palace	Kent	9	"A very honest-hearted fellow, and as poor as the King."
I	IV	The Duke of Albany's Palace	Lear	10	"If thou be'st as poor for a subject as he's for a king, thou art poor enough. What wouldst thou?"
I	IV	The Duke of Albany's Palace	Kent	11	Service.
I	IV	The Duke of Albany's Palace	Lear	12	Who wouldst thou serve?
I	IV	The Duke of Albany's Palace	Kent	13	You.
I	IV	The Duke of Albany's Palace	Lear	14	"Dost thou know me, fellow?"
I	IV	The Duke of Albany's Palace	Kent	15	"No, sir; but you have that in your countenance which I would fain call master."
I	IV	The Duke of Albany's Palace	Lear	16	What's that?
I	IV	The Duke of Albany's Palace	Kent	17	Authority.
I	IV	The Duke of Albany's Palace	Lear	18	What services canst thou do?
I	IV	The Duke of Albany's Palace	Kent	19	"I can keep honest counsel, ride, run, mar a curious tale in telling it and deliver a plain message bluntly. That which ordinary men are fit for, I am qualified in, and the best of me is diligence."
I	IV	The Duke of Albany's Palace	Lear	20	How old art thou?
I	IV	The Duke of Albany's Palace	Kent	21	"Not so young, sir, to love a woman for singing, nor so old to dote on her for anything. I have years on my back forty-eight."
I	IV	The Duke of Albany's Palace	Lear	22	"Follow me; thou shalt serve me. If I like thee no worse after dinner, I will not part from thee yet. Dinner, ho, dinner! Where's my knave? my fool? Go you and call my fool hither."
I	IV	The Duke of Albany's Palace	STAGE	23	[Exit an attendant.]
I	IV	The Duke of Albany's Palace	STAGE	24	Enter [Oswald the] Steward.
I	IV	The Duke of Albany's Palace	Lear	25	"You, you, sirrah, where's my daughter?"
I	IV	The Duke of Albany's Palace	Oswald	26	So please you- Exit.
I	IV	The Duke of Albany's Palace	Lear	27	"What says the fellow there? Call the clotpoll back. [Exit a Knight.] Where's my fool, ho? I think the world's asleep."
I	IV	The Duke of Albany's Palace	STAGE	28	[Enter Knight]
I	IV	The Duke of Albany's Palace	Lear	29	How now? Where's that mongrel?
I	IV	The Duke of Albany's Palace	Knight	30	"He says, my lord, your daughter is not well."
I	IV	The Duke of Albany's Palace	Lear	31	Why came not the slave back to me when I call'd him?
I	IV	The Duke of Albany's Palace	Knight	32	"Sir, he answered me in the roundest manner, he would not."
I	IV	The Duke of Albany's Palace	Lear	33	He would not?
I	IV	The Duke of Albany's Palace	Knight	34	"My lord, I know not what the matter is; but to my judgment your Highness is not entertain'd with that ceremonious affection as you were wont. There's a great abatement of kindness appears as well in the general dependants as in the Duke himself also and your daughter."
I	IV	The Duke of Albany's Palace	Lear	35	Ha! say'st thou so?
I	IV	The Duke of Albany's Palace	Knight	36	"I beseech you pardon me, my lord, if I be mistaken; for my duty cannot be silent when I think your Highness wrong'd."
I	IV	The Duke of Albany's Palace	Lear	37	"Thou but rememb'rest me of mine own conception. I have perceived a most faint neglect of late, which I have rather blamed as mine own jealous curiosity than as a very pretence and purpose of unkindness. I will look further into't. But where's my fool? I have not seen him this two days."
I	IV	The Duke of Albany's Palace	Knight	38	"Since my young lady's going into France, sir, the fool hath much pined away."
I	IV	The Duke of Albany's Palace	Lear	39	"No more of that; I have noted it well. Go you and tell my daughter I would speak with her. [Exit Knight.] Go you, call hither my fool."
I	IV	The Duke of Albany's Palace	STAGE	40	[Exit an Attendant.]
I	IV	The Duke of Albany's Palace	STAGE	41	Enter [Oswald the] Steward.
I	IV	The Duke of Albany's Palace	Lear	42	"O, you, sir, you! Come you hither, sir. Who am I, sir?"
I	IV	The Duke of Albany's Palace	Oswald	43	My lady's father.
I	IV	The Duke of Albany's Palace	Lear	44	'My lady's father'? My lord's knave! You whoreson dog! you slave! you cur!
I	IV	The Duke of Albany's Palace	Oswald	45	"I am none of these, my lord; I beseech your pardon."
I	IV	The Duke of Albany's Palace	Lear	46	"Do you bandy looks with me, you rascal? [Strikes him.]"
I	IV	The Duke of Albany's Palace	Oswald	47	"I'll not be strucken, my lord."
I	IV	The Duke of Albany's Palace	Kent	48	"Nor tripp'd neither, you base football player? [Trips up his heels.]"
I	IV	The Duke of Albany's Palace	Lear	49	"I thank thee, fellow. Thou serv'st me, and I'll love thee."
I	IV	The Duke of Albany's Palace	Kent	50	"Come, sir, arise, away! I'll teach you differences. Away, away! If you will measure your lubber's length again, tarry; but away! Go to! Have you wisdom? So. [Pushes him out.]"
I	IV	The Duke of Albany's Palace	Lear	51	"Now, my friendly knave, I thank thee. There's earnest of thy service. [Gives money.]"
I	IV	The Duke of Albany's Palace	STAGE	52	Enter Fool.
I	IV	The Duke of Albany's Palace	Fool	53	Let me hire him too. Here's my coxcomb. [Offers Kent his cap.]
I	IV	The Duke of Albany's Palace	Lear	54	"How now, my pretty knave? How dost thou?"
I	IV	The Duke of Albany's Palace	Fool	55	"Sirrah, you were best take my coxcomb."
I	IV	The Duke of Albany's Palace	Kent	56	"Why, fool?"
I	IV	The Duke of Albany's Palace	Fool	57	"Why? For taking one's part that's out of favour. Nay, an thou canst not smile as the wind sits, thou'lt catch cold shortly. There, take my coxcomb! Why, this fellow hath banish'd two on's daughters, and did the third a blessing against his will. If thou follow him, thou must needs wear my coxcomb.- How now, nuncle? Would I had two coxcombs and two daughters!"
I	IV	The Duke of Albany's Palace	Lear	58	"Why, my boy?"
I	IV	The Duke of Albany's Palace	Fool	59	"If I gave them all my living, I'ld keep my coxcombs myself. There's mine! beg another of thy daughters."
I	IV	The Duke of Albany's Palace	Lear	60	"Take heed, sirrah- the whip."
I	IV	The Duke of Albany's Palace	Fool	61	"Truth's a dog must to kennel; he must be whipp'd out, when Lady the brach may stand by th' fire and stink."
I	IV	The Duke of Albany's Palace	Lear	62	A pestilent gall to me!
I	IV	The Duke of Albany's Palace	Fool	63	"Sirrah, I'll teach thee a speech."
I	IV	The Duke of Albany's Palace	Lear	64	Do.
I	IV	The Duke of Albany's Palace	Fool	65	"Mark it, nuncle. Have more than thou showest, Speak less than thou knowest, Lend less than thou owest, Ride more than thou goest, Learn more than thou trowest, Set less than thou throwest; Leave thy drink and thy whore, And keep in-a-door, And thou shalt have more Than two tens to a score."
I	IV	The Duke of Albany's Palace	Kent	66	"This is nothing, fool."
I	IV	The Duke of Albany's Palace	Fool	67	"Then 'tis like the breath of an unfeed lawyer- you gave me nothing for't. Can you make no use of nothing, nuncle?"
I	IV	The Duke of Albany's Palace	Lear	68	"Why, no, boy. Nothing can be made out of nothing."
I	IV	The Duke of Albany's Palace	Fool	69	"[to Kent] Prithee tell him, so much the rent of his land comes to. He will not believe a fool."
I	IV	The Duke of Albany's Palace	Lear	70	A bitter fool!
I	IV	The Duke of Albany's Palace	Fool	71	"Dost thou know the difference, my boy, between a bitter fool and a sweet fool?"
I	IV	The Duke of Albany's Palace	Lear	72	"No, lad; teach me."
I	IV	The Duke of Albany's Palace	Fool	73	"That lord that counsell'd thee To give away thy land, Come place him here by me- Do thou for him stand. The sweet and bitter fool Will presently appear; The one in motley here, The other found out there."
I	IV	The Duke of Albany's Palace	Lear	74	"Dost thou call me fool, boy?"
I	IV	The Duke of Albany's Palace	Fool	75	All thy other titles thou hast given away; that thou wast born with.
I	IV	The Duke of Albany's Palace	Kent	76	"This is not altogether fool, my lord."
I	IV	The Duke of Albany's Palace	Fool	77	"No, faith; lords and great men will not let me. If I had a monopoly out, they would have part on't. And ladies too, they will not let me have all the fool to myself; they'll be snatching. Give me an egg, nuncle, and I'll give thee two crowns."
I	IV	The Duke of Albany's Palace	Lear	78	What two crowns shall they be?
I	IV	The Duke of Albany's Palace	Fool	79	"Why, after I have cut the egg i' th' middle and eat up the meat, the two crowns of the egg. When thou clovest thy crown i' th' middle and gav'st away both parts, thou bor'st thine ass on thy back o'er the dirt. Thou hadst little wit in thy bald crown when thou gav'st thy golden one away. If I speak like myself in this, let him be whipp'd that first finds it so. [Sings] Fools had ne'er less grace in a year, For wise men are grown foppish; They know not how their wits to wear, Their manners are so apish."
I	IV	The Duke of Albany's Palace	Lear	80	"When were you wont to be so full of songs, sirrah?"
I	IV	The Duke of Albany's Palace	Fool	81	"I have us'd it, nuncle, ever since thou mad'st thy daughters thy mother; for when thou gav'st them the rod, and put'st down thine own breeches, [Sings] Then they for sudden joy did weep, And I for sorrow sung, That such a king should play bo-peep And go the fools among. Prithee, nuncle, keep a schoolmaster that can teach thy fool to lie. I would fain learn to lie."
I	IV	The Duke of Albany's Palace	Lear	82	"An you lie, sirrah, we'll have you whipp'd."
I	IV	The Duke of Albany's Palace	Fool	83	"I marvel what kin thou and thy daughters are. They'll have me whipp'd for speaking true; thou'lt have me whipp'd for lying; and sometimes I am whipp'd for holding my peace. I had rather be any kind o' thing than a fool! And yet I would not be thee, nuncle. Thou hast pared thy wit o' both sides and left nothing i' th' middle. Here comes one o' the parings."
I	IV	The Duke of Albany's Palace	STAGE	84	Enter Goneril.
I	IV	The Duke of Albany's Palace	Lear	85	"How now, daughter? What makes that frontlet on? Methinks you are too much o' late i' th' frown."
I	IV	The Duke of Albany's Palace	Fool	86	"Thou wast a pretty fellow when thou hadst no need to care for her frowning. Now thou art an O without a figure. I am better than thou art now: I am a fool, thou art nothing. [To Goneril] Yes, forsooth, I will hold my tongue. So your face bids me, though you say nothing. Mum, mum! He that keeps nor crust nor crum, Weary of all, shall want some.- [Points at Lear] That's a sheal'd peascod."
I	IV	The Duke of Albany's Palace	Goneril	87	"Not only, sir, this your all-licens'd fool, But other of your insolent retinue Do hourly carp and quarrel, breaking forth In rank and not-to-be-endured riots. Sir, I had thought, by making this well known unto you, To have found a safe redress, but now grow fearful, By what yourself, too, late have spoke and done, That you protect this course, and put it on By your allowance; which if you should, the fault Would not scape censure, nor the redresses sleep, Which, in the tender of a wholesome weal, Might in their working do you that offence Which else were shame, that then necessity Must call discreet proceeding."
I	IV	The Duke of Albany's Palace	Fool	88	"For you know, nuncle, The hedge-sparrow fed the cuckoo so long That it had it head bit off by it young. So out went the candle, and we were left darkling."
I	IV	The Duke of Albany's Palace	Lear	89	Are you our daughter?
I	IV	The Duke of Albany's Palace	Goneril	90	"Come, sir, I would you would make use of that good wisdom Whereof I know you are fraught, and put away These dispositions that of late transform you From what you rightly are."
I	IV	The Duke of Albany's Palace	Fool	91	"May not an ass know when the cart draws the horse? Whoop, Jug, I love thee!"
I	IV	The Duke of Albany's Palace	Lear	92	"Doth any here know me? This is not Lear. Doth Lear walk thus? speak thus? Where are his eyes? Either his notion weakens, his discernings Are lethargied- Ha! waking? 'Tis not so! Who is it that can tell me who I am?"
I	IV	The Duke of Albany's Palace	Fool	93	Lear's shadow.
I	IV	The Duke of Albany's Palace	Lear	94	"I would learn that; for, by the marks of sovereignty, Knowledge, and reason, I should be false persuaded I had daughters."
I	IV	The Duke of Albany's Palace	Fool	95	Which they will make an obedient father.
I	IV	The Duke of Albany's Palace	Lear	96	"Your name, fair gentlewoman?"
I	IV	The Duke of Albany's Palace	Goneril	97	"This admiration, sir, is much o' th' savour Of other your new pranks. I do beseech you To understand my purposes aright. As you are old and reverend, you should be wise. Here do you keep a hundred knights and squires; Men so disorder'd, so debosh'd, and bold That this our court, infected with their manners, Shows like a riotous inn. Epicurism and lust Make it more like a tavern or a brothel Than a grac'd palace. The shame itself doth speak For instant remedy. Be then desir'd By her that else will take the thing she begs A little to disquantity your train, And the remainder that shall still depend To be such men as may besort your age, Which know themselves, and you."
I	IV	The Duke of Albany's Palace	Lear	97	"Darkness and devils! Saddle my horses! Call my train together! Degenerate bastard, I'll not trouble thee; Yet have I left a daughter."
I	IV	The Duke of Albany's Palace	Goneril	98	"You strike my people, and your disorder'd rabble Make servants of their betters."
I	IV	The Duke of Albany's Palace	STAGE	99	Enter Albany.
I	IV	The Duke of Albany's Palace	Lear	100	"Woe that too late repents!- O, sir, are you come? Is it your will? Speak, sir!- Prepare my horses. Ingratitude, thou marble-hearted fiend, More hideous when thou show'st thee in a child Than the sea-monster!"
I	IV	The Duke of Albany's Palace	Albany	101	"Pray, sir, be patient."
I	IV	The Duke of Albany's Palace	Lear	102	"[to Goneril] Detested kite, thou liest! My train are men of choice and rarest parts, That all particulars of duty know And in the most exact regard support The worships of their name.- O most small fault, How ugly didst thou in Cordelia show! Which, like an engine, wrench'd my frame of nature From the fix'd place; drew from my heart all love And added to the gall. O Lear, Lear, Lear! Beat at this gate that let thy folly in [Strikes his head.] And thy dear judgment out! Go, go, my people."
I	IV	The Duke of Albany's Palace	Albany	103	"My lord, I am guiltless, as I am ignorant Of what hath mov'd you."
I	IV	The Duke of Albany's Palace	Lear	104	"It may be so, my lord. Hear, Nature, hear! dear goddess, hear! Suspend thy purpose, if thou didst intend To make this creature fruitful. Into her womb convey sterility; Dry up in her the organs of increase; And from her derogate body never spring A babe to honour her! If she must teem, Create her child of spleen, that it may live And be a thwart disnatur'd torment to her. Let it stamp wrinkles in her brow of youth, With cadent tears fret channels in her cheeks, Turn all her mother's pains and benefits To laughter and contempt, that she may feel How sharper than a serpent's tooth it is To have a thankless child! Away, away! Exit."
I	IV	The Duke of Albany's Palace	Albany	105	"Now, gods that we adore, whereof comes this?"
I	IV	The Duke of Albany's Palace	Goneril	106	Never afflict yourself to know the cause; But let his disposition have that scope That dotage gives it.
I	IV	The Duke of Albany's Palace	STAGE	107	Enter Lear.
I	IV	The Duke of Albany's Palace	Lear	108	"What, fifty of my followers at a clap? Within a fortnight?"
I	IV	The Duke of Albany's Palace	Albany	109	"What's the matter, sir?"
I	IV	The Duke of Albany's Palace	Lear	110	"I'll tell thee. [To Goneril] Life and death! I am asham'd That thou hast power to shake my manhood thus; That these hot tears, which break from me perforce, Should make thee worth them. Blasts and fogs upon thee! Th' untented woundings of a father's curse Pierce every sense about thee!- Old fond eyes, Beweep this cause again, I'll pluck ye out, And cast you, with the waters that you lose, To temper clay. Yea, is it come to this? Let it be so. Yet have I left a daughter, Who I am sure is kind and comfortable. When she shall hear this of thee, with her nails She'll flay thy wolvish visage. Thou shalt find That I'll resume the shape which thou dost think I have cast off for ever; thou shalt, I warrant thee."
I	IV	The Duke of Albany's Palace	STAGE	111	"Exeunt [Lear, Kent, and Attendants]."
I	IV	The Duke of Albany's Palace	Goneril	112	"Do you mark that, my lord?"
I	IV	The Duke of Albany's Palace	Albany	113	"I cannot be so partial, Goneril, To the great love I bear you -"
I	IV	The Duke of Albany's Palace	Goneril	114	"Pray you, content.- What, Oswald, ho! [To the Fool] You, sir, more knave than fool, after your master!"
I	IV	The Duke of Albany's Palace	Fool	115	"Nuncle Lear, nuncle Lear, tarry! Take the fool with thee. A fox when one has caught her, And such a daughter, Should sure to the slaughter, If my cap would buy a halter. So the fool follows after. Exit."
I	IV	The Duke of Albany's Palace	Goneril	116	"This man hath had good counsel! A hundred knights? 'Tis politic and safe to let him keep At point a hundred knights; yes, that on every dream, Each buzz, each fancy, each complaint, dislike, He may enguard his dotage with their pow'rs And hold our lives in mercy.- Oswald, I say!"
I	IV	The Duke of Albany's Palace	Albany	117	"Well, you may fear too far."
I	IV	The Duke of Albany's Palace	Goneril	118	"Safer than trust too far. Let me still take away the harms I fear, Not fear still to be taken. I know his heart. What he hath utter'd I have writ my sister. If she sustain him and his hundred knights, When I have show'd th' unfitness-"
I	IV	The Duke of Albany's Palace	STAGE	119	Enter [Oswald the] Steward.
I	IV	The Duke of Albany's Palace	Goneril	120	"How now, Oswald? What, have you writ that letter to my sister?"
I	IV	The Duke of Albany's Palace	Oswald	121	"Yes, madam."
I	IV	The Duke of Albany's Palace	Goneril	122	"Take you some company, and away to horse! Inform her full of my particular fear, And thereto add such reasons of your own As may compact it more. Get you gone, And hasten your return. [Exit Oswald.] No, no, my lord! This milky gentleness and course of yours, Though I condemn it not, yet, under pardon, You are much more at task for want of wisdom Than prais'd for harmful mildness."
I	IV	The Duke of Albany's Palace	Albany	123	"How far your eyes may pierce I cannot tell. Striving to better, oft we mar what's well."
I	IV	The Duke of Albany's Palace	Goneril	124	Nay then-
I	IV	The Duke of Albany's Palace	Albany	125	"Well, well; th' event."
I	IV	The Duke of Albany's Palace	STAGE	126	Exeunt.
I	V	Court before the Duke of Albany's Palace	STAGE	1	"Enter Lear, Kent, and Fool."
I	V	Court before the Duke of Albany's Palace	Lear	2	"Go you before to Gloucester with these letters. Acquaint my daughter no further with anything you know than comes from her demand out of the letter. If your diligence be not speedy, I shall be there afore you."
I	V	Court before the Duke of Albany's Palace	Kent	3	"I will not sleep, my lord, till I have delivered your letter."
I	V	Court before the Duke of Albany's Palace	STAGE	4	Exit.
I	V	Court before the Duke of Albany's Palace	Fool	5	"If a man's brains were in's heels, were't not in danger of kibes?"
I	V	Court before the Duke of Albany's Palace	Lear	6	"Ay, boy."
I	V	Court before the Duke of Albany's Palace	Fool	7	Then I prithee be merry. Thy wit shall ne'er go slip-shod.
I	V	Court before the Duke of Albany's Palace	Lear	8	"Ha, ha, ha!"
I	V	Court before the Duke of Albany's Palace	Fool	9	"Shalt see thy other daughter will use thee kindly; for though she's as like this as a crab's like an apple, yet I can tell what I can tell."
I	V	Court before the Duke of Albany's Palace	Lear	10	"What canst tell, boy?"
I	V	Court before the Duke of Albany's Palace	Fool	11	She'll taste as like this as a crab does to a crab. Thou canst tell why one's nose stands i' th' middle on's face?
I	V	Court before the Duke of Albany's Palace	Lear	12	No.
I	V	Court before the Duke of Albany's Palace	Fool	13	"Why, to keep one's eyes of either side's nose, that what a man cannot smell out, 'a may spy into."
I	V	Court before the Duke of Albany's Palace	Lear	14	I did her wrong.
I	V	Court before the Duke of Albany's Palace	Fool	15	Canst tell how an oyster makes his shell?
I	V	Court before the Duke of Albany's Palace	Lear	16	No.
I	V	Court before the Duke of Albany's Palace	Fool	17	Nor I neither; but I can tell why a snail has a house.
I	V	Court before the Duke of Albany's Palace	Lear	18	Why?
I	V	Court before the Duke of Albany's Palace	Fool	19	"Why, to put's head in; not to give it away to his daughters, and leave his horns without a case."
I	V	Court before the Duke of Albany's Palace	Lear	20	I will forget my nature. So kind a father!- Be my horses ready?
I	V	Court before the Duke of Albany's Palace	Fool	21	Thy asses are gone about 'em. The reason why the seven stars are no moe than seven is a pretty reason.
I	V	Court before the Duke of Albany's Palace	Lear	22	Because they are not eight?
I	V	Court before the Duke of Albany's Palace	Fool	23	Yes indeed. Thou wouldst make a good fool.
I	V	Court before the Duke of Albany's Palace	Lear	24	To tak't again perforce! Monster ingratitude!
I	V	Court before the Duke of Albany's Palace	Fool	25	"If thou wert my fool, nuncle, I'ld have thee beaten for being old before thy time."
I	V	Court before the Duke of Albany's Palace	Lear	26	How's that?

No. What I should deny (As this I would; ay, though thou didst produce My very character), I'ld turn it all To thy suggestion, plot, and damned practice; And thou must make a dullard of the world, If they not thought the profits of my death Were very pregnant and potential spurs To make thee seek it.'"

II	II	Before Gloucester's Castle	Kent	13	"A knave; a rascal; an eater of broken meats; a base, proud, shallow, beggarly, three-suited, hundred-pound, filthy, worsted-stocking knave; a lily-liver'd, action-taking, whoreson, glass-gazing, superserviceable, finical rogue; one-trunk-inheriting slave; one that wouldst be a bawd in way of good service, and art nothing but the composition of a knave, beggar, coward, pander, and the son and heir of a mongrel bitch; one whom I will beat into clamorous whining, if thou deny the least syllable of thy addition."
II	II	Before Gloucester's Castle	Oswald	14	"Why, what a monstrous fellow art thou, thus to rail on one that's neither known of thee nor knows thee!"
II	II	Before Gloucester's Castle	Kent	15	"What a brazen-fac'd varlet art thou, to deny thou knowest me! Is it two days ago since I beat thee and tripp'd up thy heels before the King? [Draws his sword.] Draw, you rogue! for, though it be night, yet the moon shines. I'll make a sop o' th' moonshine o' you. Draw, you whoreson cullionly barbermonger! draw!"

II	II	Before Gloucester's Castle	Cornwall	30	Thou art a strange fellow. A tailor make a man?
II	II	Before Gloucester's Castle	Kent	31	"Ay, a tailor, sir. A stonecutter or a painter could not have made him so ill, though he had been but two hours at the trade."
II	II	Before Gloucester's Castle	Cornwall	32	"Speak yet, how grew your quarrel?"
II	II	Before Gloucester's Castle	Oswald	33	"This ancient ruffian, sir, whose life I have spar'd At suit of his grey beard-"
II	II	Before Gloucester's Castle	Kent	34	"Thou whoreson zed! thou unnecessary letter! My lord, if you'll give me leave, I will tread this unbolted villain into mortar and daub the walls of a jakes with him. 'Spare my grey beard,' you wagtail?"
II	II	Before Gloucester's Castle	Cornwall	35	"Peace, sirrah! You beastly knave, know you no reverence?"
II	II	Before Gloucester's Castle	Kent	36	"Yes, sir, but anger hath a privilege."
II	II	Before Gloucester's Castle	Cornwall	37	Why art thou angry?
II	II	Before Gloucester's Castle	Kent	38	"That such a slave as this should wear a sword, Who wears no honesty. Such smiling rogues as these, Like rats, oft bite the holy cords atwain Which are too intrinse t' unloose; smooth every passion That in the natures of their lords rebel, Bring oil to fire, snow to their colder moods; Renege, affirm, and turn their halcyon beaks With every gale and vary of their masters, Knowing naught (like dogs) but following. A plague upon your epileptic visage! Smile you my speeches, as I were a fool? Goose, an I had you upon Sarum Plain, I'ld drive ye cackling home to Camelot."
II	II	Before Gloucester's Castle	Cornwall	39	"What, art thou mad, old fellow?"
II	II	Before Gloucester's Castle	Gloucester	40	How fell you out? Say that.
II	II	Before Gloucester's Castle	Kent	41	No contraries hold more antipathy Than I and such a knave.
II	II	Before Gloucester's Castle	Cornwall	42	Why dost thou call him knave? What is his fault?
II	II	Before Gloucester's Castle	Kent	43	His countenance likes me not.
II	II	Before Gloucester's Castle	Cornwall	44	"No more perchance does mine, or his, or hers."
II	II	Before Gloucester's Castle	Kent	45	"Sir, 'tis my occupation to be plain. I have seen better faces in my time Than stands on any shoulder that I see Before me at this instant."
II	II	Before Gloucester's Castle	Cornwall	46	"This is some fellow Who, having been prais'd for bluntness, doth affect A saucy roughness, and constrains the garb Quite from his nature. He cannot flatter, he! An honest mind and plain- he must speak truth! An they will take it, so; if not, he's plain. These kind of knaves I know which in this plainness Harbour more craft and more corrupter ends Than twenty silly-ducking observants That stretch their duties nicely."
II	II	Before Gloucester's Castle	Kent	47	"Sir, in good faith, in sincere verity, Under th' allowance of your great aspect, Whose influence, like the wreath of radiant fire On flickering Phoebus' front-"
II	II	Before Gloucester's Castle	Cornwall	48	What mean'st by this?
II	II	Before Gloucester's Castle	Kent	49	"To go out of my dialect, which you discommend so much. I know, sir, I am no flatterer. He that beguil'd you in a plain accent was a plain knave, which, for my part, I will not be, though I should win your displeasure to entreat me to't."
II	II	Before Gloucester's Castle	Cornwall	50	What was th' offence you gave him?
II	II	Before Gloucester's Castle	Oswald	51	"I never gave him any. It pleas'd the King his master very late To strike at me, upon his misconstruction; When he, conjunct, and flattering his displeasure, Tripp'd me behind; being down, insulted, rail'd And put upon him such a deal of man That worthied him, got praises of the King For him attempting who was self-subdu'd; And, in the fleshment of this dread exploit, Drew on me here again."
II	II	Before Gloucester's Castle	Kent	52	None of these rogues and cowards But Ajax is their fool.
II	II	Before Gloucester's Castle	Cornwall	53	"Fetch forth the stocks! You stubborn ancient knave, you reverent braggart, We'll teach you-"
II	II	Before Gloucester's Castle	Kent	54	"Sir, I am too old to learn. Call not your stocks for me. I serve the King; On whose employment I was sent to you. You shall do small respect, show too bold malice Against the grace and person of my master, Stocking his messenger."
II	II	Before Gloucester's Castle	Cornwall	55	"Fetch forth the stocks! As I have life and honour, There shall he sit till noon."
II	II	Before Gloucester's Castle	Regan	56	"Till noon? Till night, my lord, and all night too!"
II	II	Before Gloucester's Castle	Kent	57	"Why, madam, if I were your father's dog, You should not use me so."
II	II	Before Gloucester's Castle	Regan	58	"Sir, being his knave, I will."
II	II	Before Gloucester's Castle	Cornwall	59	"This is a fellow of the selfsame colour Our sister speaks of. Come, bring away the stocks!"
II	II	Before Gloucester's Castle	STAGE	60	Stocks brought out.
II	II	Before Gloucester's Castle	Gloucester	61	"Let me beseech your Grace not to do so. His fault is much, and the good King his master Will check him for't. Your purpos'd low correction Is such as basest and contemn'dest wretches For pilf'rings and most common trespasses Are punish'd with. The King must take it ill That he, so slightly valued in his messenger, Should have him thus restrain'd."
II	II	Before Gloucester's Castle	Cornwall	62	I'll answer that.
II	II	Before Gloucester's Castle	Regan	63	"My sister may receive it much more worse, To have her gentleman abus'd, assaulted, For following her affairs. Put in his legs. [Kent is put in the stocks.] Come, my good lord, away."
II	II	Before Gloucester's Castle	STAGE	64	Exeunt [all but Gloucester and Kent].
II	II	Before Gloucester's Castle	Gloucester	65	"I am sorry for thee, friend. 'Tis the Duke's pleasure, Whose disposition, all the world well knows, Will not be rubb'd nor stopp'd. I'll entreat for thee."
II	II	Before Gloucester's Castle	Kent	66	"Pray do not, sir. I have watch'd and travell'd hard. Some time I shall sleep out, the rest I'll whistle. A good man's fortune may grow out at heels. Give you good morrow!"
II	II	Before Gloucester's Castle	Gloucester	67	The Duke 's to blame in this; 'twill be ill taken.

No port is free, no place That guard and most unusual vigilance Does not attend my taking. Whiles I may scape, I will preserve myself; and am bethought To take the basest and most poorest shape That ever penury, in contempt of man, Brought near to beast. My face I'll grime with filth, Blanket my loins, elf all my hair in knots, And with presented nakedness outface The winds and persecutions of the sky. The country gives me proof and precedent Of Bedlam beggars, who, with roaring voices, Strike in their numb'd and mortified bare arms Pins, wooden pricks, nails, sprigs of rosemary; And with this horrible object, from low farms, Poor pelting villages, sheepcotes, and mills, Sometime with lunatic bans, sometime with prayers, Enforce their charity.

II	IV	Before Gloucester's Castle	Fool	7	"Ha, ha! look! he wears cruel garters. Horses are tied by the head, dogs and bears by th' neck, monkeys by th' loins, and men by th' legs. When a man's over-lusty at legs, then he wears wooden nether-stocks."
II	IV	Before Gloucester's Castle	Lear	8	What's he that hath so much thy place mistook To set thee here?
II	IV	Before Gloucester's Castle	Kent	9	It is both he and she- Your son and daughter.

II	IV	Before Gloucester's Castle	Kent	19	"My lord, when at their home I did commend your Highness' letters to them, Ere I was risen from the place that show'd My duty kneeling, came there a reeking post, Stew'd in his haste, half breathless, panting forth From Goneril his mistress salutations; Deliver'd letters, spite of intermission, Which presently they read; on whose contents, They summon'd up their meiny, straight took horse, Commanded me to follow and attend The leisure of their answer, gave me cold looks, And meeting here the other messenger, Whose welcome I perceiv'd had poison'd mine- Being the very fellow which of late Display'd so saucily against your Highness- Having more man than wit about me, drew. He rais'd the house with loud and coward cries. Your son and daughter found this trespass worth The shame which here it suffers."
II	IV	Before Gloucester's Castle	Fool	20	"Winter's not gone yet, if the wild geese fly that way. Fathers that wear rags Do make their children blind; But fathers that bear bags Shall see their children kind. Fortune, that arrant whore, Ne'er turns the key to th' poor. But for all this, thou shalt have as many dolours for thy daughters as thou canst tell in a year."
II	IV	Before Gloucester's Castle	Lear	21	"O, how this mother swells up toward my heart! Hysterica passio! Down, thou climbing sorrow! Thy element's below! Where is this daughter?"

II	IV	Before Gloucester's Castle	Kent	28	"Why, fool?"
II	IV	Before Gloucester's Castle	Fool	29	"We'll set thee to school to an ant, to teach thee there's no labouring i' th' winter. All that follow their noses are led by their eyes but blind men, and there's not a nose among twenty but can smell him that's stinking. Let go thy hold when a great wheel runs down a hill, lest it break thy neck with following it; but the great one that goes upward, let him draw thee after. When a wise man gives thee better counsel, give me mine again. I would have none but knaves follow it, since a fool gives it. That sir which serves and seeks for gain, And follows but for form, Will pack when it begins to rain And leave thee in the storm. But I will tarry; the fool will stay, And let the wise man fly. The knave turns fool that runs away; The fool no knave, perdy."

II	IV	Before Gloucester's Castle	Lear	35	"Vengeance! plague! death! confusion! Fiery? What quality? Why, Gloucester, Gloucester, I'ld speak with the Duke of Cornwall and his wife."
II	IV	Before Gloucester's Castle	Gloucester	36	"Well, my good lord, I have inform'd them so."
II	IV	Before Gloucester's Castle	Lear	37	"Inform'd them? Dost thou understand me, man?"
II	IV	Before Gloucester's Castle	Gloucester	38	"Ay, my good lord."
II	IV	Before Gloucester's Castle	Lear	39	"The King would speak with Cornwall; the dear father Would with his daughter speak, commands her service. Are they inform'd of this? My breath and blood! Fiery? the fiery Duke? Tell the hot Duke that- No, but not yet! May be he is not well. Infirmity doth still neglect all office Whereto our health is bound. We are not ourselves When nature, being oppress'd, commands the mind To suffer with the body. I'll forbear; And am fallen out with my more headier will, To take the indispos'd and sickly fit For the sound man.- Death on my state! Wherefore Should be sit here? This act persuades me That this remotion of the Duke and her Is practice only. Give me my servant forth. Go tell the Duke and 's wife I'ld speak with them- Now, presently. Bid them come forth and hear me, Or at their chamber door I'll beat the drum Till it cry sleep to death."
II	IV	Before Gloucester's Castle	Gloucester	40	I would have all well betwixt you.
II	IV	Before Gloucester's Castle	STAGE	41	Exit.
II	IV	Before Gloucester's Castle	Lear	42	"O me, my heart, my rising heart! But down!"
II	IV	Before Gloucester's Castle	Fool	43	"Cry to it, nuncle, as the cockney did to the eels when she put 'em i' th' paste alive. She knapp'd 'em o' th' coxcombs with a stick and cried 'Down, wantons, down!' 'Twas her brother that, in pure kindness to his horse, buttered his hay."
II	IV	Before Gloucester's Castle	STAGE	44	"Enter Cornwall, Regan, Gloucester, Servants."
II	IV	Before Gloucester's Castle	Lear	45	Good morrow to you both.
II	IV	Before Gloucester's Castle	Cornwall	46	Hail to your Grace!
II	IV	Before Gloucester's Castle	STAGE	47	Kent here set at liberty.
II	IV	Before Gloucester's Castle	Regan	48	I am glad to see your Highness.
II	IV	Before Gloucester's Castle	Lear	49	"Regan, I think you are; I know what reason I have to think so. If thou shouldst not be glad, I would divorce me from thy mother's tomb, Sepulchring an adultress. [To Kent] O, are you free? Some other time for that.- Beloved Regan, Thy sister's naught. O Regan, she hath tied Sharp-tooth'd unkindness, like a vulture, here! [Lays his hand on his heart.] I can scarce speak to thee. Thou'lt not believe With how deprav'd a quality- O Regan!"
II	IV	Before Gloucester's Castle	Regan	50	"I pray you, sir, take patience. I have hope You less know how to value her desert Than she to scant her duty."
II	IV	Before Gloucester's Castle	Lear	51	"Say, how is that?"
II	IV	Before Gloucester's Castle	Regan	52	"I cannot think my sister in the least Would fail her obligation. If, sir, perchance She have restrain'd the riots of your followers, 'Tis on such ground, and to such wholesome end, As clears her from all blame."
II	IV	Before Gloucester's Castle	Lear	53	My curses on her!
II	IV	Before Gloucester's Castle	Regan	54	"O, sir, you are old! Nature in you stands on the very verge Of her confine. You should be rul'd, and led By some discretion that discerns your state Better than you yourself. Therefore I pray you That to our sister you do make return; Say you have wrong'd her, sir."
II	IV	Before Gloucester's Castle	Lear	55	"Ask her forgiveness? Do you but mark how this becomes the house: 'Dear daughter, I confess that I am old. [Kneels.] Age is unnecessary. On my knees I beg That you'll vouchsafe me raiment, bed, and food.'"
II	IV	Before Gloucester's Castle	Regan	56	"Good sir, no more! These are unsightly tricks. Return you to my sister."
II	IV	Before Gloucester's Castle	Lear	57	"[rises] Never, Regan! She hath abated me of half my train; Look'd black upon me; struck me with her tongue, Most serpent-like, upon the very heart. All the stor'd vengeances of heaven fall On her ingrateful top! Strike her young bones, You taking airs, with lameness!"
II	IV	Before Gloucester's Castle	Cornwall	58	"Fie, sir, fie!"
II	IV	Before Gloucester's Castle	Lear	59	"You nimble lightnings, dart your blinding flames Into her scornful eyes! Infect her beauty, You fen-suck'd fogs, drawn by the pow'rful sun, To fall and blast her pride!"
II	IV	Before Gloucester's Castle	Regan	60	O the blest gods! so will you wish on me When the rash mood is on.
II	IV	Before Gloucester's Castle	Lear	61	"No, Regan, thou shalt never have my curse. Thy tender-hefted nature shall not give Thee o'er to harshness. Her eyes are fierce; but thine Do comfort, and not burn. 'Tis not in thee To grudge my pleasures, to cut off my train, To bandy hasty words, to scant my sizes, And, in conclusion, to oppose the bolt Against my coming in. Thou better know'st The offices of nature, bond of childhood, Effects of courtesy, dues of gratitude. Thy half o' th' kingdom hast thou not forgot, Wherein I thee endow'd."
II	IV	Before Gloucester's Castle	Regan	62	"Good sir, to th' purpose."
II	IV	Before Gloucester's Castle	STAGE	63	Tucket within.
II	IV	Before Gloucester's Castle	Lear	64	Who put my man i' th' stocks?
II	IV	Before Gloucester's Castle	Cornwall	65	What trumpet's that?
II	IV	Before Gloucester's Castle	Regan	66	"I know't- my sister's. This approves her letter, That she would soon be here."
II	IV	Before Gloucester's Castle	STAGE	67	Enter [Oswald the] Steward.
II	IV	Before Gloucester's Castle	Regan	68	Is your lady come?
II	IV	Before Gloucester's Castle	Lear	69	"This is a slave, whose easy-borrowed pride Dwells in the fickle grace of her he follows. Out, varlet, from my sight!"
II	IV	Before Gloucester's Castle	Cornwall	70	What means your Grace?
II	IV	Before Gloucester's Castle	STAGE	71	Enter Goneril.
II	IV	Before Gloucester's Castle	Lear	72	"Who stock'd my servant? Regan, I have good hope Thou didst not know on't.- Who comes here? O heavens! If you do love old men, if your sweet sway Allow obedience- if yourselves are old, Make it your cause! Send down, and take my part! [To Goneril] Art not asham'd to look upon this beard?- O Regan, wilt thou take her by the hand?"
II	IV	Before Gloucester's Castle	Goneril	73	"Why not by th' hand, sir? How have I offended? All's not offence that indiscretion finds And dotage terms so."
II	IV	Before Gloucester's Castle	Lear	74	"O sides, you are too tough! Will you yet hold? How came my man i' th' stocks?"
II	IV	Before Gloucester's Castle	Cornwall	75	"I set him there, sir; but his own disorders Deserv'd much less advancement."
II	IV	Before Gloucester's Castle	Lear	76	You? Did you?
II	IV	Before Gloucester's Castle	Regan	77	"I pray you, father, being weak, seem so. If, till the expiration of your month, You will return and sojourn with my sister, Dismissing half your train, come then to me. I am now from home, and out of that provision Which shall be needful for your entertainment."
II	IV	Before Gloucester's Castle	Lear	78	"Return to her, and fifty men dismiss'd? No, rather I abjure all roofs, and choose To wage against the enmity o' th' air, To be a comrade with the wolf and owl- Necessity's sharp pinch! Return with her? Why, the hot-blooded France, that dowerless took Our youngest born, I could as well be brought To knee his throne, and, squire-like, pension beg To keep base life afoot. Return with her? Persuade me rather to be slave and sumpter To this detested groom. [Points at Oswald.]"
II	IV	Before Gloucester's Castle	Goneril	79	"At your choice, sir."
II	IV	Before Gloucester's Castle	Lear	80	"I prithee, daughter, do not make me mad. I will not trouble thee, my child; farewell. We'll no more meet, no more see one another. But yet thou art my flesh, my blood, my daughter; Or rather a disease that's in my flesh, Which I must needs call mine. Thou art a boil, A plague sore, an embossed carbuncle In my corrupted blood. But I'll not chide thee. Let shame come when it will, I do not call it. I do not bid the Thunder-bearer shoot Nor tell tales of thee to high-judging Jove. Mend when thou canst; be better at thy leisure; I can be patient, I can stay with Regan, I and my hundred knights."
II	IV	Before Gloucester's Castle	Regan	81	"Not altogether so. I look'd not for you yet, nor am provided For your fit welcome. Give ear, sir, to my sister; For those that mingle reason with your passion Must be content to think you old, and so- But she knows what she does."
II	IV	Before Gloucester's Castle	Lear	82	Is this well spoken?
II	IV	Before Gloucester's Castle	Regan	83	"I dare avouch it, sir. What, fifty followers? Is it not well? What should you need of more? Yea, or so many, sith that both charge and danger Speak 'gainst so great a number? How in one house Should many people, under two commands, Hold amity? 'Tis hard; almost impossible."
II	IV	Before Gloucester's Castle	Goneril	84	"Why might not you, my lord, receive attendance From those that she calls servants, or from mine?"
II	IV	Before Gloucester's Castle	Regan	85	"Why not, my lord? If then they chanc'd to slack ye, We could control them. If you will come to me (For now I spy a danger), I entreat you To bring but five-and-twenty. To no more Will I give place or notice."
II	IV	Before Gloucester's Castle	Lear	86	I gave you all-
II	IV	Before Gloucester's Castle	Regan	87	And in good time you gave it!
II	IV	Before Gloucester's Castle	Lear	88	"Made you my guardians, my depositaries; But kept a reservation to be followed With such a number. What, must I come to you With five-and-twenty, Regan? Said you so?"
II	IV	Before Gloucester's Castle	Regan	88	And speak't again my lord. No more with me.
II	IV	Before Gloucester's Castle	Lear	89	"Those wicked creatures yet do look well-favour'd When others are more wicked; not being the worst Stands in some rank of praise. [To Goneril] I'll go with thee. Thy fifty yet doth double five-and-twenty, And thou art twice her love."
II	IV	Before Gloucester's Castle	Goneril	90	"Hear, me, my lord. What need you five-and-twenty, ten, or five, To follow in a house where twice so many Have a command to tend you?"
II	IV	Before Gloucester's Castle	Regan	91	What need one?
II	IV	Before Gloucester's Castle	Lear	92	"O, reason not the need! Our basest beggars Are in the poorest thing superfluous. Allow not nature more than nature needs, Man's life is cheap as beast's. Thou art a lady: If only to go warm were gorgeous, Why, nature needs not what thou gorgeous wear'st Which scarcely keeps thee warm. But, for true need- You heavens, give me that patience, patience I need! You see me here, you gods, a poor old man, As full of grief as age; wretched in both. If it be you that stirs these daughters' hearts Against their father, fool me not so much To bear it tamely; touch me with noble anger, And let not women's weapons, water drops, Stain my man's cheeks! No, you unnatural hags! I will have such revenges on you both That all the world shall- I will do such things- What they are yet, I know not; but they shall be The terrors of the earth! You think I'll weep. No, I'll not weep. I have full cause of weeping, but this heart Shall break into a hundred thousand flaws Or ere I'll weep. O fool, I shall go mad!"
II	IV	Before Gloucester's Castle	STAGE	93	"Exeunt Lear, Gloucester, Kent, and Fool. Storm and tempest."
II	IV	Before Gloucester's Castle	Cornwall	94	Let us withdraw; 'twill be a storm.
II	IV	Before Gloucester's Castle	Regan	95	This house is little; the old man and 's people Cannot be well bestow'd.
II	IV	Before Gloucester's Castle	Goneril	96	'Tis his own blame; hath put himself from rest And must needs taste his folly.
II	IV	Before Gloucester's Castle	Regan	97	"For his particular, I'll receive him gladly, But not one follower."
II	IV	Before Gloucester's Castle	Goneril	98	So am I purpos'd. Where is my Lord of Gloucester?
II	IV	Before Gloucester's Castle	Cornwall	99	Followed the old man forth.
II	IV	Before Gloucester's Castle	STAGE	100	Enter Gloucester.
II	IV	Before Gloucester's Castle	Goneril	101	He is return'd.
II	IV	Before Gloucester's Castle	Gloucester	102	The King is in high rage.
II	IV	Before Gloucester's Castle	Cornwall	103	Whither is he going?
II	IV	Before Gloucester's Castle	Gloucester	104	"He calls to horse, but will I know not whither."
II	IV	Before Gloucester's Castle	Cornwall	105	'Tis best to give him way; he leads himself.
II	IV	Before Gloucester's Castle	Goneril	106	"My lord, entreat him by no means to stay."
II	IV	Before Gloucester's Castle	Gloucester	107	"Alack, the night comes on, and the bleak winds Do sorely ruffle. For many miles about There's scarce a bush."
II	IV	Before Gloucester's Castle	Regan	108	"O, sir, to wilful men The injuries that they themselves procure Must be their schoolmasters. Shut up your doors. He is attended with a desperate train, And what they may incense him to, being apt To have his ear abus'd, wisdom bids fear."
II	IV	Before Gloucester's Castle	Cornwall	109	"Shut up your doors, my lord: 'tis a wild night. My Regan counsels well. Come out o' th' storm."
II	IV	Before Gloucester's Castle	STAGE	110	Exeunt.
III	I	A heath	STAGE	1	Storm still. Enter Kent and a Gentleman at several doors.
III	I	A heath	Kent	2	"Who's there, besides foul weather?"
III	I	A heath	Gentleman	3	"One minded like the weather, most unquietly."
III	I	A heath	Kent	4	I know you. Where's the King?
III	I	A heath	Gentleman	5	"Contending with the fretful elements; Bids the wind blow the earth into the sea, Or swell the curled waters 'bove the main, That things might change or cease; tears his white hair, Which the impetuous blasts, with eyeless rage, Catch in their fury and make nothing of; Strives in his little world of man to outscorn The to-and-fro-conflicting wind and rain. This night, wherein the cub-drawn bear would couch, The lion and the belly-pinched wolf Keep their fur dry, unbonneted he runs, And bids what will take all."
III	I	A heath	Kent	6	But who is with him?
III	I	A heath	Gentleman	7	"None but the fool, who labours to outjest His heart-struck injuries."
III	I	A heath	Kent	8	"Sir, I do know you, And dare upon the warrant of my note Commend a dear thing to you. There is division (Although as yet the face of it be cover'd With mutual cunning) 'twixt Albany and Cornwall; Who have (as who have not, that their great stars Thron'd and set high?) servants, who seem no less, Which are to France the spies and speculations Intelligent of our state. What hath been seen, Either in snuffs and packings of the Dukes, Or the hard rein which both of them have borne Against the old kind King, or something deeper, Whereof, perchance, these are but furnishings- But, true it is, from France there comes a power Into this scattered kingdom, who already, Wise in our negligence, have secret feet In some of our best ports and are at point To show their open banner. Now to you: If on my credit you dare build so far To make your speed to Dover, you shall find Some that will thank you, making just report Of how unnatural and bemadding sorrow The King hath cause to plain. I am a gentleman of blood and breeding, And from some knowledge and assurance offer This office to you."
III	I	A heath	Gentleman	9	I will talk further with you.
III	I	A heath	Kent	10	"No, do not. For confirmation that I am much more Than my out-wall, open this purse and take What it contains. If you shall see Cordelia (As fear not but you shall), show her this ring, And she will tell you who your fellow is That yet you do not know. Fie on this storm! I will go seek the King."
III	I	A heath	Gentleman	11	Give me your hand. Have you no more to say?
III	I	A heath	Kent	12	"Few words, but, to effect, more than all yet: That, when we have found the King (in which your pain That way, I'll this), he that first lights on him Holla the other."
III	I	A heath	STAGE	13	Exeunt [severally].
III	II	Another part of the heath	STAGE	1	Storm still. Enter Lear and Fool.
III	II	Another part of the heath	Lear	2	"Blow, winds, and crack your cheeks! rage! blow! You cataracts and hurricanoes, spout Till you have drench'd our steeples, drown'd the cocks! You sulph'rous and thought-executing fires, Vaunt-couriers to oak-cleaving thunderbolts, Singe my white head! And thou, all-shaking thunder, Strike flat the thick rotundity o' th' world, Crack Nature's moulds, all germains spill at once, That makes ingrateful man!"
III	II	Another part of the heath	Fool	3	"O nuncle, court holy water in a dry house is better than this rain water out o' door. Good nuncle, in, and ask thy daughters blessing! Here's a night pities nether wise men nor fools."
III	II	Another part of the heath	Lear	4	"Rumble thy bellyful! Spit, fire! spout, rain! Nor rain, wind, thunder, fire are my daughters. I tax not you, you elements, with unkindness. I never gave you kingdom, call'd you children, You owe me no subscription. Then let fall Your horrible pleasure. Here I stand your slave, A poor, infirm, weak, and despis'd old man. But yet I call you servile ministers, That will with two pernicious daughters join Your high-engender'd battles 'gainst a head So old and white as this! O! O! 'tis foul!"
III	II	Another part of the heath	Fool	5	"He that has a house to put 's head in has a good head-piece. The codpiece that will house Before the head has any, The head and he shall louse: So beggars marry many. The man that makes his toe What he his heart should make Shall of a corn cry woe, And turn his sleep to wake. For there was never yet fair woman but she made mouths in a glass."
III	II	Another part of the heath	STAGE	6	Enter Kent.
III	II	Another part of the heath	Lear	7	"No, I will be the pattern of all patience; I will say nothing."
III	II	Another part of the heath	Kent	8	Who's there?
III	II	Another part of the heath	Fool	9	"Marry, here's grace and a codpiece; that's a wise man and a fool."
III	II	Another part of the heath	Kent	10	"Alas, sir, are you here? Things that love night Love not such nights as these. The wrathful skies Gallow the very wanderers of the dark And make them keep their caves. Since I was man, Such sheets of fire, such bursts of horrid thunder, Such groans of roaring wind and rain, I never Remember to have heard. Man's nature cannot carry Th' affliction nor the fear."
III	II	Another part of the heath	Lear	11	"Let the great gods, That keep this dreadful pudder o'er our heads, Find out their enemies now. Tremble, thou wretch, That hast within thee undivulged crimes Unwhipp'd of justice. Hide thee, thou bloody hand; Thou perjur'd, and thou simular man of virtue That art incestuous. Caitiff, in pieces shake That under covert and convenient seeming Hast practis'd on man's life. Close pent-up guilts, Rive your concealing continents, and cry These dreadful summoners grace. I am a man More sinn'd against than sinning."
III	II	Another part of the heath	Kent	12	"Alack, bareheaded? Gracious my lord, hard by here is a hovel; Some friendship will it lend you 'gainst the tempest. Repose you there, whilst I to this hard house (More harder than the stones whereof 'tis rais'd, Which even but now, demanding after you, Denied me to come in) return, and force Their scanted courtesy."
III	II	Another part of the heath	Lear	13	"My wits begin to turn. Come on, my boy. How dost, my boy? Art cold? I am cold myself. Where is this straw, my fellow? The art of our necessities is strange, That can make vile things precious. Come, your hovel. Poor fool and knave, I have one part in my heart That's sorry yet for thee."
III	II	Another part of the heath	Fool	14	"[sings] He that has and a little tiny wit- With hey, ho, the wind and the rain- Must make content with his fortunes fit, For the rain it raineth every day."
III	II	Another part of the heath	Lear	15	"True, my good boy. Come, bring us to this hovel."
III	II	Another part of the heath	STAGE	16	Exeunt [Lear and Kent].
III	II	Another part of the heath	Fool	17	"This is a brave night to cool a courtesan. I'll speak a prophecy ere I go: When priests are more in word than matter; When brewers mar their malt with water; When nobles are their tailors' tutors, No heretics burn'd, but wenches' suitors; When every case in law is right, No squire in debt nor no poor knight; When slanders do not live in tongues, Nor cutpurses come not to throngs; When usurers tell their gold i' th' field, And bawds and whores do churches build: Then shall the realm of Albion Come to great confusion. Then comes the time, who lives to see't, That going shall be us'd with feet. This prophecy Merlin shall make, for I live before his time."
III	II	Another part of the heath	STAGE	18	Exit.
III	III	Gloucester's Castle	STAGE	1	Enter Gloucester and Edmund.
III	III	Gloucester's Castle	Gloucester	2	"Alack, alack, Edmund, I like not this unnatural dealing! When I desir'd their leave that I might pity him, they took from me the use of mine own house, charg'd me on pain of perpetual displeasure neither to speak of him, entreat for him, nor any way sustain him."
III	III	Gloucester's Castle	Edmund	3	Most savage and unnatural!
III	III	Gloucester's Castle	Gloucester	4	"Go to; say you nothing. There is division betwixt the Dukes, and a worse matter than that. I have received a letter this night- 'tis dangerous to be spoken- I have lock'd the letter in my closet. These injuries the King now bears will be revenged home; there's part of a power already footed; we must incline to the King. I will seek him and privily relieve him. Go you and maintain talk with the Duke, that my charity be not of him perceived. If he ask for me, I am ill and gone to bed. Though I die for't, as no less is threat'ned me, the King my old master must be relieved. There is some strange thing toward, Edmund. Pray you be careful."
III	III	Gloucester's Castle	STAGE	5	Exit.
III	III	Gloucester's Castle	Edmund	6	"This courtesy, forbid thee, shall the Duke Instantly know, and of that letter too. This seems a fair deserving, and must draw me That which my father loses- no less than all. The younger rises when the old doth fall."
III	III	Gloucester's Castle	STAGE	7	Exit.
III	IV	The heath. Before a hovel	STAGE	1	"Storm still. Enter Lear, Kent, and Fool."
III	IV	The heath. Before a hovel	Kent	2	"Here is the place, my lord. Good my lord, enter. The tyranny of the open night 's too rough For nature to endure."
III	IV	The heath. Before a hovel	Lear	3	Let me alone.
III	IV	The heath. Before a hovel	Kent	4	"Good my lord, enter here."
III	IV	The heath. Before a hovel	Lear	5	Wilt break my heart?
III	IV	The heath. Before a hovel	Kent	6	"I had rather break mine own. Good my lord, enter."
III	IV	The heath. Before a hovel	Lear	7	"Thou think'st 'tis much that this contentious storm Invades us to the skin. So 'tis to thee; But where the greater malady is fix'd, The lesser is scarce felt. Thou'dst shun a bear; But if thy flight lay toward the raging sea, Thou'dst meet the bear i' th' mouth. When the mind's free, The body's delicate. The tempest in my mind Doth from my senses take all feeling else Save what beats there. Filial ingratitude! Is it not as this mouth should tear this hand For lifting food to't? But I will punish home! No, I will weep no more. In such a night 'To shut me out! Pour on; I will endure. In such a night as this! O Regan, Goneril! Your old kind father, whose frank heart gave all! O, that way madness lies; let me shun that! No more of that."
III	IV	The heath. Before a hovel	Kent	8	"Good my lord, enter here."
III	IV	The heath. Before a hovel	Lear	9	"Prithee go in thyself; seek thine own ease. This tempest will not give me leave to ponder On things would hurt me more. But I'll go in. [To the Fool] In, boy; go first.- You houseless poverty- Nay, get thee in. I'll pray, and then I'll sleep."
III	IV	The heath. Before a hovel	STAGE	10	Exit [Fool].
III	IV	The heath. Before a hovel	Lear	11	"Poor naked wretches, wheresoe'er you are, That bide the pelting of this pitiless storm, How shall your houseless heads and unfed sides, Your loop'd and window'd raggedness, defend you From seasons such as these? O, I have ta'en Too little care of this! Take physic, pomp; Expose thyself to feel what wretches feel, That thou mayst shake the superflux to them And show the heavens more just."
III	IV	The heath. Before a hovel	Edgar	12	"[within] Fathom and half, fathom and half! Poor Tom!"
III	IV	The heath. Before a hovel	STAGE	13	Enter Fool [from the hovel].
III	IV	The heath. Before a hovel	Fool	14	"Come not in here, nuncle, here's a spirit. Help me, help me!"
III	IV	The heath. Before a hovel	Kent	15	Give me thy hand. Who's there?
III	IV	The heath. Before a hovel	Fool	16	"A spirit, a spirit! He says his name's poor Tom."
III	IV	The heath. Before a hovel	Kent	17	What art thou that dost grumble there i' th' straw? Come forth.
III	IV	The heath. Before a hovel	STAGE	18	Enter Edgar [disguised as a madman].
III	IV	The heath. Before a hovel	Edgar	19	"Away! the foul fiend follows me! Through the sharp hawthorn blows the cold wind. Humh! go to thy cold bed, and warm thee."
III	IV	The heath. Before a hovel	Lear	20	"Hast thou given all to thy two daughters, and art thou come to this?"
III	IV	The heath. Before a hovel	Edgar	21	"Who gives anything to poor Tom? whom the foul fiend hath led through fire and through flame, through ford and whirlpool, o'er bog and quagmire; that hath laid knives under his pillow and halters in his pew, set ratsbane by his porridge, made him proud of heart, to ride on a bay trotting horse over four-inch'd bridges, to course his own shadow for a traitor. Bless thy five wits! Tom 's acold. O, do de, do de, do de. Bless thee from whirlwinds, star-blasting, and taking! Do poor Tom some charity, whom the foul fiend vexes. There could I have him now- and there- and there again- and there!"
III	IV	The heath. Before a hovel	STAGE	22	Storm still.
III	IV	The heath. Before a hovel	Lear	23	"What, have his daughters brought him to this pass? Couldst thou save nothing? Didst thou give 'em all?"
III	IV	The heath. Before a hovel	Fool	24	"Nay, he reserv'd a blanket, else we had been all sham'd."
III	IV	The heath. Before a hovel	Lear	25	Now all the plagues that in the pendulous air Hang fated o'er men's faults light on thy daughters!
III	IV	The heath. Before a hovel	Kent	26	"He hath no daughters, sir."
III	IV	The heath. Before a hovel	Lear	27	"Death, traitor! nothing could have subdu'd nature To such a lowness but his unkind daughters. Is it the fashion that discarded fathers Should have thus little mercy on their flesh? Judicious punishment! 'Twas this flesh begot Those pelican daughters."
III	IV	The heath. Before a hovel	Edgar	28	"Pillicock sat on Pillicock's Hill. 'Allow, 'allow, loo, loo!"
III	IV	The heath. Before a hovel	Fool	29	This cold night will turn us all to fools and madmen.
III	IV	The heath. Before a hovel	Edgar	30	Take heed o' th' foul fiend; obey thy parents: keep thy word justly; swear not; commit not with man's sworn spouse; set not thy sweet heart on proud array. Tom 's acold.

III	IV	The heath. Before a hovel	Edgar	32	"A servingman, proud in heart and mind; that curl'd my hair, wore gloves in my cap; serv'd the lust of my mistress' heart and did the act of darkness with her; swore as many oaths as I spake words, and broke them in the sweet face of heaven; one that slept in the contriving of lust, and wak'd to do it. Wine lov'd I deeply, dice dearly; and in woman out-paramour'd the Turk. False of heart, light of ear, bloody of hand; hog in sloth, fox in stealth, wolf in greediness, dog in madness, lion in prey. Let not the creaking of shoes nor the rustling of silks betray thy poor heart to woman. Keep thy foot out of brothel, thy hand out of placket, thy pen from lender's book, and defy the foul fiend. Still through the hawthorn blows the cold wind; says suum, mun, hey, no, nonny. Dolphin my boy, my boy, sessa! let him trot by."

Thou art the thing itself; unaccommodated man is no more but such a poor, bare, forked animal as thou art. Off, off, you lendings! Come, unbutton here. [Tears at his clothes.]"

He gives the web and the pin, squints the eye, and makes the harelip; mildews the white wheat, and hurts the poor creature of earth.

Mark the high noises, and thyself bewray When false opinion, whose wrong thought defiles thee, In thy just proof repeals and reconciles thee. What will hap more to-night, safe scape the King!

The sea, with such a storm as his bare head In hell-black night endur'd, would have buoy'd up And quench'd the steeled fires. Yet, poor old heart, he holp the heavens to rain. If wolves had at thy gate howl'd that stern time, Thou shouldst have said, 'Good porter, turn the key.' All cruels else subscrib'd. But I shall see The winged vengeance overtake such children."

IV	I	The heath	Gloucester	25	Sirrah naked fellow-
IV	I	The heath	Edgar	26	Poor Tom's acold. [Aside] I cannot daub it further.
IV	I	The heath	Gloucester	27	"Come hither, fellow."
IV	I	The heath	Edgar	28	"[aside] And yet I must.- Bless thy sweet eyes, they bleed."
IV	I	The heath	Gloucester	29	Know'st thou the way to Dover?
IV	I	The heath	Edgar	30	"Both stile and gate, horseway and footpath. Poor Tom hath been scar'd out of his good wits. Bless thee, good man's son, from the foul fiend! Five fiends have been in poor Tom at once: of lust, as Obidicut; Hobbididence, prince of dumbness; Mahu, of stealing; Modo, of murder; Flibbertigibbet, of mopping and mowing, who since possesses chambermaids and waiting women. So, bless thee, master!"
IV	I	The heath	Gloucester	31	"Here, take this purse, thou whom the heavens' plagues Have humbled to all strokes. That I am wretched Makes thee the happier. Heavens, deal so still! Let the superfluous and lust-dieted man, That slaves your ordinance, that will not see Because he does not feel, feel your pow'r quickly; So distribution should undo excess, And each man have enough. Dost thou know Dover?"
IV	I	The heath	Edgar	32	"Ay, master."
IV	I	The heath	Gloucester	33	"There is a cliff, whose high and bending head Looks fearfully in the confined deep. Bring me but to the very brim of it, And I'll repair the misery thou dost bear With something rich about me. From that place I shall no leading need."
IV	I	The heath	Edgar	34	Give me thy arm. Poor Tom shall lead thee.

IV	II	Before the Duke of Albany's Palace	STAGE	1	Enter Goneril and [Edmund the] Bastard.
IV	II	Before the Duke of Albany's Palace	Goneril	2	"Welcome, my lord. I marvel our mild husband Not met us on the way."
IV	II	Before the Duke of Albany's Palace	STAGE	3	Enter [Oswald the] Steward.
IV	II	Before the Duke of Albany's Palace	Goneril	4	"Now, where's your master?"
IV	II	Before the Duke of Albany's Palace	Oswald	5	"Madam, within, but never man so chang'd. I told him of the army that was landed: He smil'd at it. I told him you were coming: His answer was, 'The worse.' Of Gloucester's treachery And of the loyal service of his son When I inform'd him, then he call'd me sot And told me I had turn'd the wrong side out. What most he should dislike seems pleasant to him; What like, offensive."
IV	II	Before the Duke of Albany's Palace	Goneril	6	"[to Edmund] Then shall you go no further. It is the cowish terror of his spirit, That dares not undertake. He'll not feel wrongs Which tie him to an answer. Our wishes on the way May prove effects. Back, Edmund, to my brother. Hasten his musters and conduct his pow'rs. I must change arms at home and give the distaff Into my husband's hands. This trusty servant Shall pass between us. Ere long you are like to hear (If you dare venture in your own behalf) A mistress's command. Wear this. [Gives a favour.] Spare speech. Decline your head. This kiss, if it durst speak, Would stretch thy spirits up into the air. Conceive, and fare thee well."
IV	II	Before the Duke of Albany's Palace	Edmund	7	Yours in the ranks of death!
IV	II	Before the Duke of Albany's Palace	STAGE	8	Exit.
IV	II	Before the Duke of Albany's Palace	Goneril	9	"My most dear Gloucester! O, the difference of man and man! To thee a woman's services are due; My fool usurps my body."
IV	II	Before the Duke of Albany's Palace	Oswald	10	"Madam, here comes my lord."
IV	II	Before the Duke of Albany's Palace	STAGE	11	Exit.
IV	II	Before the Duke of Albany's Palace	STAGE	12	Enter Albany.
IV	II	Before the Duke of Albany's Palace	Goneril	13	I have been worth the whistle.
IV	II	Before the Duke of Albany's Palace	Albany	14	"O Goneril, You are not worth the dust which the rude wind Blows in your face! I fear your disposition. That nature which contemns it origin Cannot be bordered certain in itself. She that herself will sliver and disbranch From her material sap, perforce must wither And come to deadly use."
IV	II	Before the Duke of Albany's Palace	Goneril	15	No more! The text is foolish.
IV	II	Before the Duke of Albany's Palace	Albany	16	"Wisdom and goodness to the vile seem vile; Filths savour but themselves. What have you done? Tigers, not daughters, what have you perform'd? A father, and a gracious aged man, Whose reverence even the head-lugg'd bear would lick, Most barbarous, most degenerate, have you madded. Could my good brother suffer you to do it? A man, a prince, by him so benefited! If that the heavens do not their visible spirits Send quickly down to tame these vile offences, It will come, Humanity must perforce prey on itself, Like monsters of the deep."
IV	II	Before the Duke of Albany's Palace	Goneril	17	"Milk-liver'd man! That bear'st a cheek for blows, a head for wrongs; Who hast not in thy brows an eye discerning Thine honour from thy suffering; that not know'st Fools do those villains pity who are punish'd Ere they have done their mischief. Where's thy drum? France spreads his banners in our noiseless land, With plumed helm thy state begins to threat, Whiles thou, a moral fool, sit'st still, and criest 'Alack, why does he so?'"
IV	II	Before the Duke of Albany's Palace	Albany	18	"See thyself, devil! Proper deformity seems not in the fiend So horrid as in woman."
IV	II	Before the Duke of Albany's Palace	Goneril	19	O vain fool!
IV	II	Before the Duke of Albany's Palace	Albany	20	"Thou changed and self-cover'd thing, for shame! Bemonster not thy feature! Were't my fitness To let these hands obey my blood, They are apt enough to dislocate and tear Thy flesh and bones. Howe'er thou art a fiend, A woman's shape doth shield thee."
IV	II	Before the Duke of Albany's Palace	Goneril	21	"Marry, your manhood mew!"
IV	II	Before the Duke of Albany's Palace	STAGE	22	Enter a Gentleman.
IV	II	Before the Duke of Albany's Palace	Albany	23	What news?
IV	II	Before the Duke of Albany's Palace	Gentleman	24	"O, my good lord, the Duke of Cornwall 's dead, Slain by his servant, going to put out The other eye of Gloucester."
IV	II	Before the Duke of Albany's Palace	Albany	25	Gloucester's eyes?
IV	II	Before the Duke of Albany's Palace	Gentleman	26	"A servant that he bred, thrill'd with remorse, Oppos'd against the act, bending his sword To his great master; who, thereat enrag'd, Flew on him, and amongst them fell'd him dead; But not without that harmful stroke which since Hath pluck'd him after."
IV	II	Before the Duke of Albany's Palace	Albany	27	"This shows you are above, You justicers, that these our nether crimes So speedily can venge! But O poor Gloucester! Lose he his other eye?"
IV	II	Before the Duke of Albany's Palace	Gentleman	28	"Both, both, my lord. This letter, madam, craves a speedy answer. 'Tis from your sister."
IV	II	Before the Duke of Albany's Palace	Goneril	29	"[aside] One way I like this well; But being widow, and my Gloucester with her, May all the building in my fancy pluck Upon my hateful life. Another way The news is not so tart.- I'll read, and answer."
IV	II	Before the Duke of Albany's Palace	STAGE	30	Exit.
IV	II	Before the Duke of Albany's Palace	Albany	31	Where was his son when they did take his eyes?
IV	II	Before the Duke of Albany's Palace	Gentleman	32	Come with my lady hither.
IV	II	Before the Duke of Albany's Palace	Albany	33	He is not here.
IV	II	Before the Duke of Albany's Palace	Gentleman	34	"No, my good lord; I met him back again."
IV	II	Before the Duke of Albany's Palace	Albany	35	Knows he the wickedness?
IV	II	Before the Duke of Albany's Palace	Gentleman	36	"Ay, my good lord. 'Twas he inform'd against him, And quit the house on purpose, that their punishment Might have the freer course."
IV	II	Before the Duke of Albany's Palace	Albany	37	"Gloucester, I live To thank thee for the love thou show'dst the King, And to revenge thine eyes. Come hither, friend. Tell me what more thou know'st."
IV	II	Before the Duke of Albany's Palace	STAGE	38	Exeunt.
IV	III	The French camp near Dover	STAGE	1	Enter Kent and a Gentleman.
IV	III	The French camp near Dover	Kent	2	Why the King of France is so suddenly gone back know you the reason?
IV	III	The French camp near Dover	Gentleman	3	"Something he left imperfect in the state, which since his coming forth is thought of, which imports to the kingdom so much fear and danger that his personal return was most required and necessary."
IV	III	The French camp near Dover	Kent	4	Who hath he left behind him general?
IV	III	The French camp near Dover	Gentleman	5	"The Marshal of France, Monsieur La Far."
IV	III	The French camp near Dover	Kent	6	Did your letters pierce the Queen to any demonstration of grief?
IV	III	The French camp near Dover	Gentleman	7	"Ay, sir. She took them, read them in my presence, And now and then an ample tear trill'd down Her delicate cheek. It seem'd she was a queen Over her passion, who, most rebel-like, Sought to be king o'er her."
IV	III	The French camp near Dover	Kent	8	"O, then it mov'd her?"
IV	III	The French camp near Dover	Gentleman	9	"Not to a rage. Patience and sorrow strove Who should express her goodliest. You have seen Sunshine and rain at once: her smiles and tears Were like, a better way. Those happy smilets That play'd on her ripe lip seem'd not to know What guests were in her eyes, which parted thence As pearls from diamonds dropp'd. In brief, Sorrow would be a rarity most belov'd, If all could so become it."
IV	III	The French camp near Dover	Kent	10	Made she no verbal question?
IV	III	The French camp near Dover	Gentleman	11	"Faith, once or twice she heav'd the name of father Pantingly forth, as if it press'd her heart; Cried 'Sisters, sisters! Shame of ladies! Sisters! Kent! father! sisters! What, i' th' storm? i' th' night? Let pity not be believ'd!' There she shook The holy water from her heavenly eyes, And clamour moisten'd. Then away she started To deal with grief alone."
IV	III	The French camp near Dover	Kent	12	"It is the stars, The stars above us, govern our conditions; Else one self mate and mate could not beget Such different issues. You spoke not with her since?"
IV	III	The French camp near Dover	Gentleman	13	No.
IV	III	The French camp near Dover	Kent	14	Was this before the King return'd?
IV	III	The French camp near Dover	Gentleman	15	"No, since."
IV	III	The French camp near Dover	Kent	16	"Well, sir, the poor distressed Lear's i' th' town; Who sometime, in his better tune, remembers What we are come about, and by no means Will yield to see his daughter."
IV	III	The French camp near Dover	Gentleman	17	"Why, good sir?"
IV	III	The French camp near Dover	Kent	18	"A sovereign shame so elbows him; his own unkindness, That stripp'd her from his benediction, turn'd her To foreign casualties, gave her dear rights To his dog-hearted daughters- these things sting His mind so venomously that burning shame Detains him from Cordelia."
IV	III	The French camp near Dover	Gentleman	19	"Alack, poor gentleman!"
IV	III	The French camp near Dover	Kent	20	Of Albany's and Cornwall's powers you heard not?
IV	III	The French camp near Dover	Gentleman	21	'Tis so; they are afoot.
IV	III	The French camp near Dover	Kent	22	"Well, sir, I'll bring you to our master Lear And leave you to attend him. Some dear cause Will in concealment wrap me up awhile. When I am known aright, you shall not grieve Lending me this acquaintance. I pray you go Along with me."
IV	III	The French camp near Dover	STAGE	23	Exeunt.
IV	IV	The French camp	STAGE	1	"Enter, with Drum and Colours, Cordelia, Doctor, and Soldiers."
IV	IV	The French camp	Cordelia	2	"Alack, 'tis he! Why, he was met even now As mad as the vex'd sea, singing aloud, Crown'd with rank fumiter and furrow weeds, With hardocks, hemlock, nettles, cuckoo flow'rs, Darnel, and all the idle weeds that grow In our sustaining corn. A century send forth. Search every acre in the high-grown field And bring him to our eye. [Exit an Officer.] What can man's wisdom In the restoring his bereaved sense? He that helps him take all my outward worth."
IV	IV	The French camp	Doctor	3	"There is means, madam. Our foster nurse of nature is repose, The which he lacks. That to provoke in him Are many simples operative, whose power Will close the eye of anguish."
IV	IV	The French camp	Cordelia	4	"All blest secrets, All you unpublish'd virtues of the earth, Spring with my tears! be aidant and remediate In the good man's distress! Seek, seek for him! Lest his ungovern'd rage dissolve the life That wants the means to lead it."
IV	IV	The French camp	STAGE	5	Enter Messenger.
IV	IV	The French camp	Messenger	6	"News, madam. The British pow'rs are marching hitherward."
IV	IV	The French camp	Cordelia	7	"'Tis known before. Our preparation stands In expectation of them. O dear father, It is thy business that I go about. Therefore great France My mourning and important tears hath pitied. No blown ambition doth our arms incite, But love, dear love, and our ag'd father's right. Soon may I hear and see him!"
IV	IV	The French camp	STAGE	8	Exeunt.
IV	V	Gloucester's Castle	STAGE	1	Enter Regan and [Oswald the] Steward.
IV	V	Gloucester's Castle	Regan	2	But are my brother's pow'rs set forth?
IV	V	Gloucester's Castle	Oswald	3	"Ay, madam."
IV	V	Gloucester's Castle	Regan	4	Himself in person there?
IV	V	Gloucester's Castle	Oswald	5	"Madam, with much ado. Your sister is the better soldier."
IV	V	Gloucester's Castle	Regan	6	Lord Edmund spake not with your lord at home?
IV	V	Gloucester's Castle	Oswald	7	"No, madam."
IV	V	Gloucester's Castle	Regan	8	What might import my sister's letter to him?
IV	V	Gloucester's Castle	Oswald	9	"I know not, lady."
IV	V	Gloucester's Castle	Regan	10	"Faith, he is posted hence on serious matter. It was great ignorance, Gloucester's eyes being out, To let him live. Where he arrives he moves All hearts against us. Edmund, I think, is gone, In pity of his misery, to dispatch His nighted life; moreover, to descry The strength o' th' enemy."
IV	V	Gloucester's Castle	Oswald	11	"I must needs after him, madam, with my letter."
IV	V	Gloucester's Castle	Regan	12	Our troops set forth to-morrow. Stay with us. The ways are dangerous.
IV	V	Gloucester's Castle	Oswald	13	"I may not, madam. My lady charg'd my duty in this business."
IV	V	Gloucester's Castle	Regan	14	"Why should she write to Edmund? Might not you Transport her purposes by word? Belike, Something- I know not what- I'll love thee much- Let me unseal the letter."
IV	V	Gloucester's Castle	Oswald	15	"Madam, I had rather-"
IV	V	Gloucester's Castle	Regan	16	I know your lady does not love her husband; I am sure of that; and at her late being here She gave strange eliads and most speaking looks To noble Edmund. I know you are of her bosom.
IV	V	Gloucester's Castle	Oswald	17	"I, madam?"
IV	V	Gloucester's Castle	Regan	18	"I speak in understanding. Y'are! I know't. Therefore I do advise you take this note. My lord is dead; Edmund and I have talk'd, And more convenient is he for my hand Than for your lady's. You may gather more. If you do find him, pray you give him this; And when your mistress hears thus much from you, I pray desire her call her wisdom to her. So farewell. If you do chance to hear of that blind traitor, Preferment falls on him that cuts him off."
IV	V	Gloucester's Castle	Oswald	19	"Would I could meet him, madam! I should show What party I do follow."
IV	V	Gloucester's Castle	Regan	20	Fare thee well.
IV	V	Gloucester's Castle	STAGE	21	Exeunt.
IV	VI	The country near Dover	STAGE	1	"Enter Gloucester, and Edgar [like a Peasant]."
IV	VI	The country near Dover	Gloucester	2	When shall I come to th' top of that same hill?
IV	VI	The country near Dover	Edgar	3	You do climb up it now. Look how we labour.
IV	VI	The country near Dover	Gloucester	4	Methinks the ground is even.
IV	VI	The country near Dover	Edgar	5	"Horrible steep. Hark, do you hear the sea?"
IV	VI	The country near Dover	Gloucester	6	"No, truly."
IV	VI	The country near Dover	Edgar	7	"Why, then, your other senses grow imperfect By your eyes' anguish."
IV	VI	The country near Dover	Gloucester	8	"So may it be indeed. Methinks thy voice is alter'd, and thou speak'st In better phrase and matter than thou didst."
IV	VI	The country near Dover	Edgar	9	Y'are much deceiv'd. In nothing am I chang'd But in my garments.
IV	VI	The country near Dover	Gloucester	10	Methinks y'are better spoken.
IV	VI	The country near Dover	Edgar	11	"Come on, sir; here's the place. Stand still. How fearful And dizzy 'tis to cast one's eyes so low! The crows and choughs that wing the midway air Show scarce so gross as beetles. Halfway down Hangs one that gathers sampire- dreadful trade! Methinks he seems no bigger than his head. The fishermen that walk upon the beach Appear like mice; and yond tall anchoring bark, Diminish'd to her cock; her cock, a buoy Almost too small for sight. The murmuring surge That on th' unnumb'red idle pebble chafes Cannot be heard so high. I'll look no more, Lest my brain turn, and the deficient sight Topple down headlong."
IV	VI	The country near Dover	Gloucester	12	Set me where you stand.
IV	VI	The country near Dover	Edgar	13	Give me your hand. You are now within a foot Of th' extreme verge. For all beneath the moon Would I not leap upright.
IV	VI	The country near Dover	Gloucester	14	"Let go my hand. Here, friend, is another purse; in it a jewel Well worth a poor man's taking. Fairies and gods Prosper it with thee! Go thou further off; Bid me farewell, and let me hear thee going."
IV	VI	The country near Dover	Edgar	15	"Now fare ye well, good sir."
IV	VI	The country near Dover	Gloucester	16	With all my heart.
IV	VI	The country near Dover	Edgar	17	[aside] Why I do trifle thus with his despair Is done to cure it.
IV	VI	The country near Dover	Gloucester	18	"O you mighty gods! [He kneels.] This world I do renounce, and, in your sights, Shake patiently my great affliction off. If I could bear it longer and not fall To quarrel with your great opposeless wills, My snuff and loathed part of nature should Burn itself out. If Edgar live, O, bless him! Now, fellow, fare thee well."
IV	VI	The country near Dover	STAGE	19	He falls [forward and swoons].
IV	VI	The country near Dover	Edgar	20	"Gone, sir, farewell.- And yet I know not how conceit may rob The treasury of life when life itself Yields to the theft. Had he been where he thought, By this had thought been past.- Alive or dead? Ho you, sir! friend! Hear you, sir? Speak!- Thus might he pass indeed. Yet he revives."
IV	VI	The country near Dover	Edgar	21	"What are you, sir?"
IV	VI	The country near Dover	Gloucester	22	"Away, and let me die."
IV	VI	The country near Dover	Edgar	23	"Hadst thou been aught but gossamer, feathers, air, So many fadom down precipitating, Thou'dst shiver'd like an egg; but thou dost breathe; Hast heavy substance; bleed'st not; speak'st; art sound. Ten masts at each make not the altitude Which thou hast perpendicularly fell. Thy life is a miracle. Speak yet again."
IV	VI	The country near Dover	Gloucester	24	"But have I fall'n, or no?"
IV	VI	The country near Dover	Edgar	25	From the dread summit of this chalky bourn. Look up a-height. The shrill-gorg'd lark so far Cannot be seen or heard. Do but look up.
IV	VI	The country near Dover	Gloucester	26	"Alack, I have no eyes! Is wretchedness depriv'd that benefit To end itself by death? 'Twas yet some comfort When misery could beguile the tyrant's rage And frustrate his proud will."
IV	VI	The country near Dover	Edgar	27	Give me your arm. Up- so. How is't? Feel you your legs? You stand.
IV	VI	The country near Dover	Gloucester	28	"Too well, too well."
IV	VI	The country near Dover	Edgar	29	This is above all strangeness. Upon the crown o' th' cliff what thing was that Which parted from you?
IV	VI	The country near Dover	Gloucester	30	A poor unfortunate beggar.
IV	VI	The country near Dover	Edgar	31	"As I stood here below, methought his eyes Were two full moons; he had a thousand noses, Horns whelk'd and wav'd like the enridged sea. It was some fiend. Therefore, thou happy father, Think that the clearest gods, who make them honours Of men's impossibility, have preserv'd thee."
IV	VI	The country near Dover	Gloucester	32	"I do remember now. Henceforth I'll bear Affliction till it do cry out itself 'Enough, enough,' and die. That thing you speak of, I took it for a man. Often 'twould say 'The fiend, the fiend'- he led me to that place."
IV	VI	The country near Dover	Edgar	33	Bear free and patient thoughts.
IV	VI	The country near Dover	STAGE	34	"Enter Lear, mad, [fantastically dressed with weeds]."
IV	VI	The country near Dover	Edgar	35	But who comes here? The safer sense will ne'er accommodate His master thus.
IV	VI	The country near Dover	Lear	36	"No, they cannot touch me for coming; I am the King himself."
IV	VI	The country near Dover	Edgar	37	O thou side-piercing sight!
IV	VI	The country near Dover	Lear	38	"Nature 's above art in that respect. There's your press money. That fellow handles his bow like a crow-keeper. Draw me a clothier's yard. Look, look, a mouse! Peace, peace; this piece of toasted cheese will do't. There's my gauntlet; I'll prove it on a giant. Bring up the brown bills. O, well flown, bird! i' th' clout, i' th' clout! Hewgh! Give the word."
IV	VI	The country near Dover	Edgar	39	Sweet marjoram.
IV	VI	The country near Dover	Lear	40	Pass.
IV	VI	The country near Dover	Gloucester	41	I know that voice.
IV	VI	The country near Dover	Lear	42	"Ha! Goneril with a white beard? They flatter'd me like a dog, and told me I had white hairs in my beard ere the black ones were there. To say 'ay' and 'no' to everything I said! 'Ay' and 'no' too was no good divinity. When the rain came to wet me once, and the wind to make me chatter; when the thunder would not peace at my bidding; there I found 'em, there I smelt 'em out. Go to, they are not men o' their words! They told me I was everything. 'Tis a lie- I am not ague-proof."
IV	VI	The country near Dover	Gloucester	43	The trick of that voice I do well remember. Is't not the King?
IV	VI	The country near Dover	Lear	44	"Ay, every inch a king! When I do stare, see how the subject quakes. I pardon that man's life. What was thy cause? Adultery? Thou shalt not die. Die for adultery? No. The wren goes to't, and the small gilded fly Does lecher in my sight. Let copulation thrive; for Gloucester's bastard son Was kinder to his father than my daughters Got 'tween the lawful sheets. To't, luxury, pell-mell! for I lack soldiers. Behold yond simp'ring dame, Whose face between her forks presageth snow, That minces virtue, and does shake the head To hear of pleasure's name. The fitchew nor the soiled horse goes to't With a more riotous appetite. Down from the waist they are Centaurs, Though women all above. But to the girdle do the gods inherit, Beneath is all the fiend's. There's hell, there's darkness, there's the sulphurous pit; burning, scalding, stench, consumption. Fie, fie, fie! pah, pah! Give me an ounce of civet, good apothecary, to sweeten my imagination. There's money for thee."
IV	VI	The country near Dover	Gloucester	45	"O, let me kiss that hand!"
IV	VI	The country near Dover	Lear	46	Let me wipe it first; it smells of mortality.
IV	VI	The country near Dover	Gloucester	47	O ruin'd piece of nature! This great world Shall so wear out to naught. Dost thou know me?
IV	VI	The country near Dover	Lear	48	"I remember thine eyes well enough. Dost thou squiny at me? No, do thy worst, blind Cupid! I'll not love. Read thou this challenge; mark but the penning of it."
IV	VI	The country near Dover	Gloucester	49	"Were all the letters suns, I could not see one."
IV	VI	The country near Dover	Edgar	50	"[aside] I would not take this from report. It is, And my heart breaks at it."
IV	VI	The country near Dover	Lear	51	Read.
IV	VI	The country near Dover	Gloucester	52	"What, with the case of eyes?"
IV	VI	The country near Dover	Lear	53	"O, ho, are you there with me? No eyes in your head, nor no money in your purse? Your eyes are in a heavy case, your purse in a light. Yet you see how this world goes."
IV	VI	The country near Dover	Gloucester	54	I see it feelingly.
IV	VI	The country near Dover	Lear	55	"What, art mad? A man may see how the world goes with no eyes. Look with thine ears. See how yond justice rails upon yond simple thief. Hark in thine ear. Change places and, handy-dandy, which is the justice, which is the thief? Thou hast seen a farmer's dog bark at a beggar?"
IV	VI	The country near Dover	Gloucester	56	"Ay, sir."
IV	VI	The country near Dover	Lear	57	"And the creature run from the cur? There thou mightst behold the great image of authority: a dog's obeyed in office. Thou rascal beadle, hold thy bloody hand! Why dost thou lash that whore? Strip thine own back. Thou hotly lusts to use her in that kind For which thou whip'st her. The usurer hangs the cozener. Through tatter'd clothes small vices do appear; Robes and furr'd gowns hide all. Plate sin with gold, And the strong lance of justice hurtless breaks; Arm it in rags, a pygmy's straw does pierce it. None does offend, none- I say none! I'll able 'em. Take that of me, my friend, who have the power To seal th' accuser's lips. Get thee glass eyes And, like a scurvy politician, seem To see the things thou dost not. Now, now, now, now! Pull off my boots. Harder, harder! So."
IV	VI	The country near Dover	Edgar	58	"O, matter and impertinency mix'd! Reason, in madness!"
IV	VI	The country near Dover	Lear	59	"If thou wilt weep my fortunes, take my eyes. I know thee well enough; thy name is Gloucester. Thou must be patient. We came crying hither; Thou know'st, the first time that we smell the air We wawl and cry. I will preach to thee. Mark."
IV	VI	The country near Dover	Gloucester	60	"Alack, alack the day!"
IV	VI	The country near Dover	Lear	61	"When we are born, we cry that we are come To this great stage of fools. This' a good block. It were a delicate stratagem to shoe A troop of horse with felt. I'll put't in proof, And when I have stol'n upon these sons-in-law, Then kill, kill, kill, kill, kill, kill!"
IV	VI	The country near Dover	STAGE	62	Enter a Gentleman [with Attendants].
IV	VI	The country near Dover	Gentleman	63	"O, here he is! Lay hand upon him.- Sir, Your most dear daughter-"

IV	VI	The country near Dover	Edgar	86	"A most poor man, made tame to fortune's blows, Who, by the art of known and feeling sorrows, Am pregnant to good pity. Give me your hand; I'll lead you to some biding."

Mine enemy's dog, Though he had bit me, should have stood that night Against my fire; and wast thou fain, poor father, To hovel thee with swine and rogues forlorn, In short and musty straw?

Where I could not be honest, I never yet was valiant. For this business, It toucheth us as France invades our land, Not bolds the King, with others whom, I fear, Most just and heavy causes make oppose."

V	I	The British camp near Dover	Albany	31	Stay till I have read the letter.

Neither can be enjoy'd, If both remain alive. To take the widow Exasperates, makes mad her sister Goneril; And hardly shall I carry out my side, Her husband being alive. Now then, we'll use His countenance for the battle, which being done, Let her who would be rid of him devise His speedy taking off. As for the mercy Which he intends to Lear and to Cordelia- The battle done, and they within our power, Shall never see his pardon; for my state Stands on me to defend, not to debate."

V	III	"The British camp, near Dover"	Lear	4	"No, no, no, no! Come, let's away to prison. We two alone will sing like birds i' th' cage. When thou dost ask me blessing, I'll kneel down And ask of thee forgiveness. So we'll live, And pray, and sing, and tell old tales, and laugh At gilded butterflies, and hear poor rogues Talk of court news; and we'll talk with them too- Who loses and who wins; who's in, who's out- And take upon 's the mystery of things, As if we were God's spies; and we'll wear out, In a wall'd prison, packs and sects of great ones That ebb and flow by th' moon."

V	III	"The British camp, near Dover"	Lear	6	"Upon such sacrifices, my Cordelia, The gods themselves throw incense. Have I caught thee? He that parts us shall bring a brand from heaven And fire us hence like foxes. Wipe thine eyes. The goodyears shall devour 'em, flesh and fell, Ere they shall make us weep! We'll see 'em starv'd first. Come."

If thou dost As this instructs thee, thou dost make thy way To noble fortunes. Know thou this, that men Are as the time is. To be tender-minded Does not become a sword.

V	III	"The British camp, near Dover"	Albany	14	"Sir, you have show'd to-day your valiant strain, And fortune led you well. You have the captives Who were the opposites of this day's strife. We do require them of you, so to use them As we shall find their merits and our safety May equally determine."
V	III	"The British camp, near Dover"	Edmund	15	"Sir, I thought it fit To send the old and miserable King To some retention and appointed guard; Whose age has charms in it, whose title more, To pluck the common bosom on his side And turn our impress'd lances in our eyes Which do command them. With him I sent the Queen, My reason all the same; and they are ready To-morrow, or at further space, t' appear Where you shall hold your session. At this time We sweat and bleed: the friend hath lost his friend; And the best quarrels, in the heat, are curs'd By those that feel their sharpness. The question of Cordelia and her father Requires a fitter place."
V	III	"The British camp, near Dover"	Albany	16	"Sir, by your patience, I hold you but a subject of this war, Not as a brother."
V	III	"The British camp, near Dover"	Regan	17	"That's as we list to grace him. Methinks our pleasure might have been demanded Ere you had spoke so far. He led our powers, Bore the commission of my place and person, The which immediacy may well stand up And call itself your brother."
V	III	"The British camp, near Dover"	Goneril	18	Not so hot! In his own grace he doth exalt himself More than in your addition.
V	III	"The British camp, near Dover"	Regan	19	"In my rights By me invested, he compeers the best."
V	III	"The British camp, near Dover"	Goneril	20	That were the most if he should husband you.
V	III	"The British camp, near Dover"	Regan	21	Jesters do oft prove prophets.
V	III	"The British camp, near Dover"	Goneril	22	"Holla, holla! That eye that told you so look'd but asquint."
V	III	"The British camp, near Dover"	Regan	23	"Lady, I am not well; else I should answer From a full-flowing stomach. General, Take thou my soldiers, prisoners, patrimony; Dispose of them, of me; the walls are thine. Witness the world that I create thee here My lord and master."
V	III	"The British camp, near Dover"	Goneril	24	Mean you to enjoy him?
V	III	"The British camp, near Dover"	Albany	25	The let-alone lies not in your good will.
V	III	"The British camp, near Dover"	Edmund	26	"Nor in thine, lord."
V	III	"The British camp, near Dover"	Albany	27	"Half-blooded fellow, yes."
V	III	"The British camp, near Dover"	Regan	28	"[to Edmund] Let the drum strike, and prove my title thine."
V	III	"The British camp, near Dover"	Albany	29	"Stay yet; hear reason. Edmund, I arrest thee On capital treason; and, in thine attaint, This gilded serpent [points to Goneril]. For your claim, fair sister, I bar it in the interest of my wife. 'Tis she is subcontracted to this lord, And I, her husband, contradict your banes. If you will marry, make your loves to me; My lady is bespoke."
V	III	"The British camp, near Dover"	Goneril	30	An interlude!
V	III	"The British camp, near Dover"	Albany	31	"Thou art arm'd, Gloucester. Let the trumpet sound. If none appear to prove upon thy person Thy heinous, manifest, and many treasons, There is my pledge [throws down a glove]! I'll prove it on thy heart, Ere I taste bread, thou art in nothing less Than I have here proclaim'd thee."
V	III	"The British camp, near Dover"	Regan	32	"Sick, O, sick!"
V	III	"The British camp, near Dover"	Goneril	33	"[aside] If not, I'll ne'er trust medicine."
V	III	"The British camp, near Dover"	Edmund	34	"There's my exchange [throws down a glove]. What in the world he is That names me traitor, villain-like he lies. Call by thy trumpet. He that dares approach, On him, on you, who not? I will maintain My truth and honour firmly."
V	III	"The British camp, near Dover"	Albany	35	"A herald, ho!"
V	III	"The British camp, near Dover"	Edmund	36	"A herald, ho, a herald!"
V	III	"The British camp, near Dover"	Albany	37	"Trust to thy single virtue; for thy soldiers, All levied in my name, have in my name Took their discharge."
V	III	"The British camp, near Dover"	Regan	38	My sickness grows upon me.

V	III	"The British camp, near Dover"	Herald	45	"(reads) 'If any man of quality or degree within the lists of the army will maintain upon Edmund, supposed Earl of Gloucester, that he is a manifold traitor, let him appear by the third sound of the trumpet. He is bold in his defence.'"
V	III	"The British camp, near Dover"	Edmund	46	Sound!
V	III	"The British camp, near Dover"	STAGE	47	First trumpet.
V	III	"The British camp, near Dover"	Herald	48	Again!
V	III	"The British camp, near Dover"	STAGE	49	Second trumpet.
V	III	"The British camp, near Dover"	Herald	50	Again!
V	III	"The British camp, near Dover"	STAGE	51	Third trumpet. Trumpet answers within.
V	III	"The British camp, near Dover"	STAGE	52	"Enter Edgar, armed, at the third sound, a Trumpet before him."
V	III	"The British camp, near Dover"	Albany	53	"Ask him his purposes, why he appears Upon this call o' th' trumpet."
V	III	"The British camp, near Dover"	Herald	54	"What are you? Your name, your quality? and why you answer This present summons?"
V	III	"The British camp, near Dover"	Edgar	55	Know my name is lost; By treason's tooth bare-gnawn and canker-bit. Yet am I noble as the adversary I come to cope.
V	III	"The British camp, near Dover"	Albany	56	Which is that adversary?
V	III	"The British camp, near Dover"	Edgar	57	What's he that speaks for Edmund Earl of Gloucester?
V	III	"The British camp, near Dover"	Edmund	58	Himself. What say'st thou to him?
V	III	"The British camp, near Dover"	Edgar	59	"Draw thy sword, That, if my speech offend a noble heart, Thy arm may do thee justice. Here is mine. Behold, it is the privilege of mine honours, My oath, and my profession. I protest- Maugre thy strength, youth, place, and eminence, Despite thy victor sword and fire-new fortune, Thy valour and thy heart- thou art a traitor; False to thy gods, thy brother, and thy father; Conspirant 'gainst this high illustrious prince; And from th' extremest upward of thy head To the descent and dust beneath thy foot, A most toad-spotted traitor. Say thou 'no,' This sword, this arm, and my best spirits are bent To prove upon thy heart, whereto I speak, Thou liest."
V	III	"The British camp, near Dover"	Edmund	60	"In wisdom I should ask thy name; But since thy outside looks so fair and warlike, And that thy tongue some say of breeding breathes, What safe and nicely I might well delay By rule of knighthood, I disdain and spurn. Back do I toss those treasons to thy head; With the hell-hated lie o'erwhelm thy heart; Which- for they yet glance by and scarcely bruise- This sword of mine shall give them instant way Where they shall rest for ever. Trumpets, speak!"
V	III	"The British camp, near Dover"	STAGE	61	Alarums. Fight. [Edmund falls.]
V	III	"The British camp, near Dover"	Albany	62	"Save him, save him!"
V	III	"The British camp, near Dover"	Goneril	63	"This is mere practice, Gloucester. By th' law of arms thou wast not bound to answer An unknown opposite. Thou art not vanquish'd, But cozen'd and beguil'd."
V	III	"The British camp, near Dover"	Albany	64	"Shut your mouth, dame, Or with this paper shall I stop it. [Shows her her letter to Edmund.]- [To Edmund]. Hold, sir. [To Goneril] Thou worse than any name, read thine own evil. No tearing, lady! I perceive you know it."
V	III	"The British camp, near Dover"	Goneril	65	"Say if I do- the laws are mine, not thine. Who can arraign me for't?"
V	III	"The British camp, near Dover"	Albany	66	Most monstrous! Know'st thou this paper?
V	III	"The British camp, near Dover"	Goneril	67	Ask me not what I know.
V	III	"The British camp, near Dover"	STAGE	68	Exit.
V	III	"The British camp, near Dover"	Albany	69	Go after her. She's desperate; govern her.
V	III	"The British camp, near Dover"	STAGE	70	[Exit an Officer.]
V	III	"The British camp, near Dover"	Edmund	71	"What, you have charg'd me with, that have I done, And more, much more. The time will bring it out. 'Tis past, and so am I.- But what art thou That hast this fortune on me? If thou'rt noble, I do forgive thee."
V	III	"The British camp, near Dover"	Edgar	72	"Let's exchange charity. I am no less in blood than thou art, Edmund; If more, the more th' hast wrong'd me. My name is Edgar and thy father's son. The gods are just, and of our pleasant vices Make instruments to scourge us. The dark and vicious place where thee he got Cost him his eyes."
V	III	"The British camp, near Dover"	Edmund	73	Th' hast spoken right; 'tis true. The wheel is come full circle; I am here.
V	III	"The British camp, near Dover"	Albany	74	"Methought thy very gait did prophesy A royal nobleness. I must embrace thee. Let sorrow split my heart if ever I Did hate thee, or thy father!"
V	III	"The British camp, near Dover"	Edgar	75	"Worthy prince, I know't."
V	III	"The British camp, near Dover"	Albany	76	Where have you hid yourself? How have you known the miseries of your father?
V	III	"The British camp, near Dover"	Edgar	77	"By nursing them, my lord. List a brief tale; And when 'tis told, O that my heart would burst! The bloody proclamation to escape That follow'd me so near (O, our lives' sweetness! That with the pain of death would hourly die Rather than die at once!) taught me to shift Into a madman's rags, t' assume a semblance That very dogs disdain'd; and in this habit Met I my father with his bleeding rings, Their precious stones new lost; became his guide, Led him, begg'd for him, sav'd him from despair; Never (O fault!) reveal'd myself unto him Until some half hour past, when I was arm'd, Not sure, though hoping of this good success, I ask'd his blessing, and from first to last Told him my pilgrimage. But his flaw'd heart (Alack, too weak the conflict to support!) 'Twixt two extremes of passion, joy and grief, Burst smilingly."
V	III	"The British camp, near Dover"	Edmund	78	"This speech of yours hath mov'd me, And shall perchance do good; but speak you on; You look as you had something more to say."
V	III	"The British camp, near Dover"	Albany	79	"If there be more, more woful, hold it in; For I am almost ready to dissolve, Hearing of this."
V	III	"The British camp, near Dover"	Edgar	80	"This would have seem'd a period To such as love not sorrow; but another, To amplify too much, would make much more, And top extremity. Whilst I was big in clamour, came there a man, Who, having seen me in my worst estate, Shunn'd my abhorr'd society; but then, finding Who 'twas that so endur'd, with his strong arms He fastened on my neck, and bellowed out As he'd burst heaven; threw him on my father; Told the most piteous tale of Lear and him That ever ear receiv'd; which in recounting His grief grew puissant, and the strings of life Began to crack. Twice then the trumpets sounded, And there I left him tranc'd."
V	III	"The British camp, near Dover"	Albany	81	But who was this?
V	III	"The British camp, near Dover"	Edgar	82	"Kent, sir, the banish'd Kent; who in disguise Followed his enemy king and did him service Improper for a slave."
V	III	"The British camp, near Dover"	STAGE	83	Enter a Gentleman with a bloody knife.
V	III	"The British camp, near Dover"	Gentleman	84	"Help, help! O, help!"
V	III	"The British camp, near Dover"	Edgar	85	What kind of help?
V	III	"The British camp, near Dover"	Albany	86	"Speak, man."
V	III	"The British camp, near Dover"	Edgar	87	What means that bloody knife?
V	III	"The British camp, near Dover"	Gentleman	88	"'Tis hot, it smokes. It came even from the heart of- O! she's dead!"
V	III	"The British camp, near Dover"	Albany	89	"Who dead? Speak, man."
V	III	"The British camp, near Dover"	Gentleman	90	"Your lady, sir, your lady! and her sister By her is poisoned; she hath confess'd it."
V	III	"The British camp, near Dover"	Edmund	91	I was contracted to them both. All three Now marry in an instant.
V	III	"The British camp, near Dover"	STAGE	92	Enter Kent.
V	III	"The British camp, near Dover"	Edgar	93	Here comes Kent.
V	III	"The British camp, near Dover"	Albany	94	"Produce their bodies, be they alive or dead."
V	III	"The British camp, near Dover"	STAGE	95	[Exit Gentleman.]
V	III	"The British camp, near Dover"	Albany	96	"This judgement of the heavens, that makes us tremble Touches us not with pity. O, is this he? The time will not allow the compliment That very manners urges."
V	III	"The British camp, near Dover"	Kent	97	I am come To bid my king and master aye good night. Is he not here?
V	III	"The British camp, near Dover"	Albany	98	"Great thing of us forgot! Speak, Edmund, where's the King? and where's Cordelia?"
V	III	"The British camp, near Dover"	STAGE	99	The bodies of Goneril and Regan are brought in.
V	III	"The British camp, near Dover"	Albany	100	"Seest thou this object, Kent?"
V	III	"The British camp, near Dover"	Kent	101	"Alack, why thus?"
V	III	"The British camp, near Dover"	Edmund	102	"Yet Edmund was belov'd. The one the other poisoned for my sake, And after slew herself."
V	III	"The British camp, near Dover"	Albany	103	Even so. Cover their faces.
V	III	"The British camp, near Dover"	Edmund	104	"I pant for life. Some good I mean to do, Despite of mine own nature. Quickly send (Be brief in't) to the castle; for my writ Is on the life of Lear and on Cordelia. Nay, send in time."
V	III	"The British camp, near Dover"	Albany	105	"Run, run, O, run!"
V	III	"The British camp, near Dover"	Edgar	106	"To who, my lord? Who has the office? Send Thy token of reprieve."
V	III	"The British camp, near Dover"	Edmund	107	Well thought on. Take my sword; Give it the Captain.
V	III	"The British camp, near Dover"	Albany	108	Haste thee for thy life.
V	III	"The British camp, near Dover"	STAGE	109	[Exit Edgar.]
V	III	"The British camp, near Dover"	Edmund	110	He hath commission from thy wife and me To hang Cordelia in the prison and To lay the blame upon her own despair That she fordid herself.
V	III	"The British camp, near Dover"	Albany	111	The gods defend her! Bear him hence awhile.
V	III	"The British camp, near Dover"	STAGE	112	[Edmund is borne off.]
V	III	"The British camp, near Dover"	STAGE	113	"Enter Lear, with Cordelia [dead] in his arms, [Edgar, Captain, and others following]."
V	III	"The British camp, near Dover"	Lear	114	"Howl, howl, howl, howl! O, you are men of stone. Had I your tongues and eyes, I'ld use them so That heaven's vault should crack. She's gone for ever! I know when one is dead, and when one lives. She's dead as earth. Lend me a looking glass. If that her breath will mist or stain the stone, Why, then she lives."
V	III	"The British camp, near Dover"	Kent	115	Is this the promis'd end?
V	III	"The British camp, near Dover"	Edgar	116	Or image of that horror?
V	III	"The British camp, near Dover"	Albany	117	Fall and cease!
V	III	"The British camp, near Dover"	Lear	118	"This feather stirs; she lives! If it be so, It is a chance which does redeem all sorrows That ever I have felt."
V	III	"The British camp, near Dover"	Kent	119	O my good master!
V	III	"The British camp, near Dover"	Lear	120	Prithee away!
V	III	"The British camp, near Dover"	Edgar	121	"'Tis noble Kent, your friend."
V	III	"The British camp, near Dover"	Lear	122	"A plague upon you, murderers, traitors all! I might have sav'd her; now she's gone for ever! Cordelia, Cordelia! stay a little. Ha! What is't thou say'st, Her voice was ever soft, Gentle, and low- an excellent thing in woman. I kill'd the slave that was a-hanging thee."
V	III	"The British camp, near Dover"	Captain	123	"'Tis true, my lords, he did."
V	III	"The British camp, near Dover"	Lear	124	"Did I not, fellow? I have seen the day, with my good biting falchion I would have made them skip. I am old now, And these same crosses spoil me. Who are you? Mine eyes are not o' th' best. I'll tell you straight."
V	III	"The British camp, near Dover"	Kent	125	"If fortune brag of two she lov'd and hated, One of them we behold."
V	III	"The British camp, near Dover"	Lear	126	This' a dull sight. Are you not Kent?
V	III	"The British camp, near Dover"	Kent	127	The same- Your servant Kent. Where is your servant Caius?
V	III	"The British camp, near Dover"	Lear	128	"He's a good fellow, I can tell you that. He'll strike, and quickly too. He's dead and rotten."
V	III	"The British camp, near Dover"	Kent	129	"No, my good lord; I am the very man-"
V	III	"The British camp, near Dover"	Lear	130	I'll see that straight.
V	III	"The British camp, near Dover"	Kent	131	That from your first of difference and decay Have followed your sad steps.
V	III	"The British camp, near Dover"	Lear	132	You're welcome hither.
V	III	"The British camp, near Dover"	Kent	133	"Nor no man else! All's cheerless, dark, and deadly. Your eldest daughters have fordone themselves, And desperately are dead."
V	III	"The British camp, near Dover"	Lear	134	"Ay, so I think."
V	III	"The British camp, near Dover"	Albany	135	He knows not what he says; and vain is it That we present us to him.
V	III	"The British camp, near Dover"	Edgar	136	Very bootless.
V	III	"The British camp, near Dover"	STAGE	137	Enter a Captain.
V	III	"The British camp, near Dover"	Captain	138	"Edmund is dead, my lord."
V	III	"The British camp, near Dover"	Albany	139	"That's but a trifle here. You lords and noble friends, know our intent. What comfort to this great decay may come Shall be applied. For us, we will resign, During the life of this old Majesty, To him our absolute power; [to Edgar and Kent] you to your rights; With boot, and Such addition as your honours Have more than merited.- All friends shall taste The wages of their virtue, and all foes The cup of their deservings.- O, see, see!"
V	III	"The British camp, near Dover"	Lear	140	"And my poor fool is hang'd! No, no, no life! Why should a dog, a horse, a rat, have life, And thou no breath at all? Thou'lt come no more, Never, never, never, never, never! Pray you undo this button. Thank you, sir. Do you see this? Look on her! look! her lips! Look there, look there!"
V	III	"The British camp, near Dover"	STAGE	141	He dies.
V	III	"The British camp, near Dover"	Edgar	142	"He faints! My lord, my lord!"
V	III	"The British camp, near Dover"	Kent	143	"Break, heart; I prithee break!"
V	III	"The British camp, near Dover"	Edgar	144	"Look up, my lord."
V	III	"The British camp, near Dover"	Kent	145	"Vex not his ghost. O, let him pass! He hates him That would upon the rack of this tough world Stretch him out longer."
V	III	"The British camp, near Dover"	Edgar	146	He is gone indeed.
V	III	"The British camp, near Dover"	Kent	147	"The wonder is, he hath endur'd so long. He but usurp'd his life."
V	III	"The British camp, near Dover"	Albany	148	"Bear them from hence. Our present business Is general woe. [To Kent and Edgar] Friends of my soul, you twain Rule in this realm, and the gor'd state sustain."
V	III	"The British camp, near Dover"	Kent	149	"I have a journey, sir, shortly to go. My master calls me; I must not say no."
V	III	"The British camp, near Dover"	Albany	150	"The weight of this sad time we must obey, Speak what we feel, not what we ought to say. The oldest have borne most; we that are young Shall never see so much, nor live so long."
V	III	"The British camp, near Dover"	STAGE	151	Exeunt with a dead march.
V	III	"The British camp, near Dover"	STAGE	152	THE END
